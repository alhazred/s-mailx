#@ mime.types(5)
#@ This is the set of MIME types that will become compiled into S-nail.
#@ Official MIME types are registered at and managed by IANA.
#@ A more complete list of actually used MIME types can be found at
#@ <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tika/trunk/tika-core/src/main/resources/\
#@ org/apache/tika/mime/tika-mimetypes.xml>.
#@ S-nail adds some more, search EXTENSION comments below.
#@ S-nail changes some TIKA things, search CHANGE comments below.
#
# Lines starting with a number sign (#) (after possible whitespace) are
# comments and discarded, empty lines are ignored, remaining ones are
# interpreted according to the scheme
#    [TYPEMARKER ]MIMETYPE whitespace EXTENSION(S, whitespace separated)
# MIMETYPE may occur several times, values are joined.
#
# Syntax extensions:
# - Follow lines may be used: instead of repeating MIMETYPE, start the next
#   line with whitespace.  (Intervening comment lines may be used.)
# - TYPEMARKER: an at sign (@) will tag the MIME type as plain text (unless
#   the user installs a specific pipe handler for the type in question).
#   . "@t@" is identical to plain "@".
#   . "@h@" will tag the MIME type as HTML tagsoup.
#   . "@H@" is identical to "@h@", but won't treat the MIME type as plain
#      text if the builtin HTML tagsoup parser isn't available, i.e., it
#      requires an explicit pipe-MIMETYPE (or pipe-EXTENSION) handler.
#   [Maybe later: . "@x@" and "@X@" are like h/H, but for XML tagsoup.]
#
# Syntax restrictions:
# - Comments must be lines of their own.
# - Only MIME types for which we have mime.c:enum mime_type constants are
#   allowed in this file here.
# - MIME types without any plain extensions are not handled by mk-mk.in.
# - Note that the order of types and extensions is preserved ...
# - Note that at least one builtin type is required (empty C array)
