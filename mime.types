# mime.types(5)
# This is the set of MIME types that will become compiled into S-nail;
# they are used as a fallback registry in case that there is no ~/.mime.types
# or /etc/mime.types.
# Lines starting with the number sign '#' are comments and ignored, empty lines
# are ignored, others must look like 'TYPEwhitespaceEXTENSION'.
# Note that these lines will be compiled AS IS, so each byte counts!
