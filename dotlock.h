/*@ S-nail - a mail user agent derived from Berkeley Mail.
 *@ Creation of an exclusive "dotlock" file.  This is (potentially) shared
 *@ in between n_dotlock() and the privilege-separated "dotlocker"..
 *@ (Which is why it doesn't use NYD or other utilities.)
 *@ The code assumes it has been chdir(2)d into the target directory and
 *@ that SIGPIPE is ignored (we react upon EPIPE).
 *@ It furtherly assumes that it can create a file name that is at least one
 *@ byte longer than the dotlock file's name!
