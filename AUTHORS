Berkeley Mail was (according to def.h) developed by Kurt Shoens, dated
March 25, 1978. I very much regret that it seems impossible to include
the people that contributed within the around fifteen years of history
of BSD Mail. If you know more about this, contact me.

After the 4.4BSD release in 1993, Mail was not further developed officially.
The code that nail is based on contains numerous patches from OpenBSD, NetBSD,
RedHat and Debian. Namely the OpenBSD/NetBSD developer Christos Zoulas wrote
much of it.

The maintainer and primary developer of nail is Gunnar Ritter <g-r@bigfoot.de>.
Nail development started in February 2000 and added especially the MIME code.

The following people contributed to nail, listed in the order of
the time of their first contribution:

Alexey A. Shelkovich sent a core file to fix an illustrous null pointer.

Anders Andersson helped by compiling on FreeBSD.

Bob Tennent found a address encoding bug, sent some Red Hat patches
	and gave important hints about the world-writeability
	of mail spool directories.
	He also informed me about libsafe of Bell Labs.

Gabor Z. Papp announced nail on http://appwatch.com.

Marcel Oliver helped in finding a type signing error.

Jacob Moorman provided support for GNU autoconf/automake.

Edward V. Popkov found a type misassignment and a missing fflush().
