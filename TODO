TODO reminder for the maintainer.
Before you start making additions to Heirloom mailx and S-nail,
subscribe to the development mailing list at
<https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/nail-devel>
to coordinate your efforts with the maintainer and other people.

v13
===

- IDNA.
- Mail-Followup-To:, if it's possible to implement it without too much
  hacking in the control flow (unlikely).
- Reformat the manual.  roff style is fine, but lines should be ~64
  characters, not ~25.

v14 (and later)
===============

- Deal with faults message selection that may occur when selecting threads
  via & (when at least mixed with other selectors).
- Try to add command line editing;  problems may be signals and even
  more longjmp()s, and how they are used at the moment.
- Revise the code:
  + Add C99-likeish typedefs for integers and use them everywhere.
  + Don't use magic constants/values.
  + Document the functions in the interface declarators.
  + Try to thin out the onion and reduce work that is done over and over
    again.  Maybe introduce objects to represent header[field/body] and
    content and find a way to pass those all through that vegetable.
  + The current maintainer worked with all-tabs for almost one and a half
    decade and turned over to all-spaces afterwards.  (Really changing this
    would make it however rather impossible to perform any cherry-picking
    onto the heirloom-plus branch.)
- Mail-Followup-To:, if it's not possible to implement it without too much
  hacking in the control flow (likely).
- Add the possibility to simply place whatever header in the editor (and
  in the mail read in due to the -t command line option, and...).
- Make it possible to really edit mails "in place".
- Check against RFC 5322.
  Really recheck all the header parsing code.
- What about RFC 6531?
- Check against newest POSIX.
- The current maintainer doesn't like longjmp()s.
- The current maintainer doesn't like signals.
- The current maintainer would like to see that compilation with a C++
  compiler is possible, though that would be a long way and be especially
  problematic due to the way enums are used.  He never understood why there
  is not "bitenum", btw.
