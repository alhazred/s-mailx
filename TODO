The following features are missing for conformance with the Single Unix
Specification, v.3:

* LC_TIME environment. This conflicts with the mail RFCs and historical
  usage. It was optional POSIX.2, but the newer standards mention this
  in the rationale only. Won't be implemented here.

* onehop variable (not demanded by POSIX standards). Seems absolutely
  obsolete. If anybody has a need for it, he should contribute code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The POP3 client supports USER/PASS authentication only. If you need
other authentication methods and have the ability to test them, please
write and contribute code.

If you want to edit arbitrary header fields with the 'editheaders'
option, you are invited to supply code for it. Be warned that this
is a nontrivial task due to MIME. Contact the maintainer before you
start coding.
