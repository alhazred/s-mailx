The following features are missing for conformance with the Single Unix
Specification, v.3:

* LC_TIME environment. This conflicts with the mail RFCs and historical
  usage. It was optional POSIX.2, but the newer standards mention this
  in the rationale only. Won't be implemented here.

* onehop variable (not demanded by POSIX standards). Seems absolutely
  obsolete. If anybody has a need for it, he should contribute code.
