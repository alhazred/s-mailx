     <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Nail</I> is an intelligent mail processing system, which has
a command syntax reminiscent of
<a href=http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/man/ed.1.html><i>ed</i></a>(1)
with lines replaced by messages.
It is based on Berkeley Mail 8.1,
is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX
<B>mailx</B> command,
and offers extensions
for MIME messages, POP3 and SMTP.
<P>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To send a message to one or more people,
<I>nail</I> can be invoked with arguments
which are the names of people
to whom the mail will be sent.
You are then expected to type in your message,
followed by an &#39;control-D&#39; at the beginning of a line.
The section below Replying to
or originating mail,
describes some features of <I>nail</I>
available to help you compose your letter.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=4>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Reading mail</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In normal usage <I>nail</I> is given no arguments
and checks your mail out of the post office,
then prints out a one line header
of each message found.
The current message is initially
the first message (numbered 1)
and can be printed using the print command
which can be abbreviated &#39;p&#39;).
You can move among the messages
much as you move between lines in
<a href=http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/man/ed.1.html><i>ed</i></a>(1),
with the commands &#39;+&#39; and &#39;-&#39; moving backwards and forwards,
and simple numbers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=5>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Disposing of mail</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After examining a message
you can delete &#39;d&#39;) the message
or reply &#39;r&#39;) to it.
Deletion causes the <I>nail</I> program
to forget about the message.
This is not irreversible;
the message can be undeleted &#39;u&#39;)
by giving its number,
or the <I>nail</I> session can be aborted
by giving the exit &#39;x&#39;) command.
Deleted messages will, however,
usually disappear never to be seen again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=6>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Specifying messages</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Commands such as print and delete
can be given a list of message numbers
as arguments to apply to a number of messages at once.
Thus &#39;<I>delete 1 2</I>&#39; deletes messages 1 and 2,
while &#39;<I>delete 1-5</I>&#39; deletes messages 1 through 5.
The following special message names exist:

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can use the reply command
to set up a response to a message,
sending it back to the person who it was from.
Text you then type in,
up to an end-of-file,
defines the contents of the message.
While you are composing a message,
<I>nail</I> treats lines beginning with the character &#39;~&#39; specially.
For instance, typing &#39;~m&#39; (alone on a line)
will place a copy of the current message into the response
right shifting it by a tabstop
(see indentprefix variable, below).
Other escapes will set up subject fields,
add and delete recipients to the message,
attach files to it
and allow you to escape to an editor
to revise the message
or to a shell to run some commands.
(These options are given in the summary below.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can end a <I>nail</I> session
with the quit &#39;q&#39;) command.
Messages which have been examined
go to your mbox file
unless they have been deleted
in which case they are discarded.
Unexamined messages go back
to the post office.
(See the -f option above).

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Personal and systemwide distribution lists</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is also possible to create
a personal distribution lists so that,
for instance, you can send mail
to &#39;<I>cohorts</I>&#39; and have it go
to a group of people.
Such lists can be defined by placing a line like
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;       <B>alias</B><I> cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory</I>
<P>
</PRE>
in the file .mailrc in your home directory.
The current list of such aliases
can be displayed with the alias command in <I>nail</I>.
System wide distribution lists can be created
by editing /etc/aliases, see
<I>aliases</I>(5)
and
<I>sendmail</I>(8);
these are kept in a different syntax.
In mail you send,
personal aliases will be expanded
in mail sent to others so that
they will be able to reply to the recipients.
System wide aliases are not expanded when the mail is sent,
but any reply returned to the machine
will have the system wide alias expanded
as all mail goes through sendmail.

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Recipient address specifications</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When an address is used to name a recipient
(in any of To, Cc, or Bcc),
names of local mail folders
and pipes to external commands
can also be specified;
the message text is then written to them.
The rules are: Any name which starts with a
&#39;<B>|</B>&#39; character specifies a pipe,
the command string following the &#39;|&#39;
is executed and the message is sent to its standard input;
any other name which contains a
&#39;<B>@</B>&#39; character is treated as a mail address;
any other name which starts with a
&#39;<B>+</B>&#39; character specifies a folder name;
any other name which contains a
&#39;<B>/</B>&#39; character
but no
&#39;<B>!</B>&#39; or
&#39;<B>%</B>&#39; character before also specifies a folder name;
what remains is treated as a mail address.
Compressed folders are handled as described for the
<I>folder</I> command below.

<I>Nail</I> has a number of options

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; MIME types</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For any outgoing attachment,
<I>nail</I> tries to determine the content type.
It does this by reading MIME type files
whose lines have the following syntax:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;       <I>type</I><B>/</B><I>subtype      extension </I>[<I>extension </I>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]
<P>
</PRE>
where type/subtype are strings describing the file contents,
and extension is the part of a filename starting after the last dot.
Any line not immediately beginning with an ASCII alphabetical character is
ignored by <I>nail</I>.
If there is a match with the extension of the file to attach,
the given type/subtype pair is used.
Otherwise, or if the filename has no extension,
the content types text/plain or application/octet-stream are used,
the first for text or international text files,
the second for any file that contains formatting characters
other than newlines and horizontal tabulators.

<A name=13>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; MIME conformance</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Nail</I> is intended to be
a MIME-conformant mail user agent,
with the following exception:
No special handling of &#39;multipart/alternative&#39; messages is performed.
All parts with content types of &#39;text&#39; or &#39;message&#39; are shown.
This is done because the user should see as much information as possible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=14>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Locale</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Nail</I> uses the LC_CTYPE locale setting
to determine whether a character is printable.
Thus, its value has to match
the character set of the terminal
<I>nail</I> runs on.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=15>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Character sets</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If a message contains non-ASCII characters,
the character set being used
must be declared within the header.
Its value can be declared
using the <I>charset</I> variable.
It is normally assumed
that this is the terminal character set, too.
If the latter differs from the one
that should be used in outgoing mail,
the <I>ttycharset</I> variable can be used
for its declaration.
An outgoing message is then converted,
resulting in errors when this process
cannot be done for the entire text;
if the message contains NUL
characters,
it is not converted.
Attachments are never converted.
Any message that is displayed on a terminal
is tried to convert, too,
with characters not in the terminal character set
replaced by question marks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=16>

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Commands</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each command is typed on a line by itself,
and may take arguments following the command word.
The command need not be typed in its entirety -
the first command which matches the typed prefix is used.
For commands which take message lists as arguments,
if no message list is given,
then the next message forward which satisfies
the command&#39;s requirements is used.
If there are no messages forward of the current message,
the search proceeds backwards,
and if there are no good messages at all,
<I>nail</I> types &#39;<I>applicable messages</I>&#39; and aborts the command.
If the command begins with a <I>#</I> sign,
the line is ignored.
<P>
The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the following methods:
<TABLE cellpadding=3><!-- tsb: The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the following methods:
 -->
<TR></TR><TR></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6%>

</TD><TD>
An argument can be enclosed between paired double-quotes
"" or single-quotes &#39;&#39;; any white space, shell
word expansion, or backslash characters within the quotes
are treated literally as part of the argument.
A double-quote will be treated literally within

List the names of the folders in your folder directory.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>folder</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
(fold) The folder command switches
to a new mail file or folder.
With no arguments, it tells you
which file you are currently reading.
If you give it an argument,
it will write out changes
(such as deletions) you have made
in the current file and read in
the new file.
Some special conventions are recognized for the name.
<B>#</B> means the previous file,
<B>%</B> means your system mailbox,
<B>%</B><I>user</I> means <I>user&#39;s</I> system mailbox,
<TT>amp;</TT> means your mbox file,
and <B>+</B><I>file</I><I> means a </I><I>file</I> in your folder directory.
<B>%:</B><I>filespec</I> expands to the same value as <I>filespec</I>,
but the file is handled as a system mailbox
e.&nbsp;g. by the mbox and save commands.
If the name matches one of the strings defined with the
<B>shortcut</B> command,
it is replaced by its long form and expanded.
If the name ends with <B>.gz</B> or <B>.bz2</B>,
it is treated as compressed with
<I>gzip</I>(1)
or
<I>bzip2</I>(1),
respectively.
Likewise, if <I>name</I> does not exist,
but either <I>name</I><B>.gz</B> or <I>name</I><B>.bz2</B> exists,
the compressed file is used.
A name of the form
<PRE>

is taken as an internet mailbox specification.
The supported protocols are currently
<B>pop3</B> (POP3)
and
<B>pop3s</B> (i. e. POP3 with SSL/TLS encryption).
Compressed files are handled as described for the
<I>folder</I> command.

will display the following message,
not the current one.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>if</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>

If new mail has arrived during the session,
the message &#39;<I>You have new mail</I>&#39; is given.
If given while editing a mailbox file with the -f flag,
then the edit file is rewritten.
A return to the Shell is effected,
unless the rewrite of edit file fails,

Add the list of header fields named to the retained list.
Only the header fields in the retain list are shown
on your terminal when you print a message.
All other header fields are suppressed.
The Type and Print commands can be used
to print a message in its entirety.
If retain is executed with no arguments,
it lists the current set of retained fields.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>Save</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
(S)
Similar to
<B>save</B>, but saves the messages

assignment statement to quote blanks
or tabs, i.e. &#39;<I>set indentprefix="-&gt;"</I>&#39;.
If an argument begins with
<B>no</B>, as in &#39;<B>set no</B><I>save</I>&#39;,
the effect is the same as invoking the
<B>unset</B> command with the remaining part of the variable
(&#39;<B>unset </B><I>save</I>&#39;).

(w) For conventional messages,
the body without all headers is written.
The output is converted
to its native format, if necessary.
If the output file exists,
the text is appended.&#151;If a message is in MIME multipart format,
its first part is written to the specified file
as for conventional messages,
and the user is asked for a filename
to save each other part.
In non-interactive mode, only the parts of the multipart message
that have a filename given in the part header are written,
the other are discarded.
The original message is never marked for deletion
in the originating mail folder.
For attachments,
the contents of the destination file are overwritten
if the file previously existed.
No special handling of compressed files is performed.

Here is a summary of the tilde escapes,
which are used when composing
messages to perform special functions.
Tilde escapes are only recognized

The name &#39;<I>tilde escape</I>&#39; is somewhat of a misnomer
since the actual escape character can be set
by the option escape.

<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>crt</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
The valued option crt is used as a threshold
to determine how long a message must be
before PAGER is used to read it.
If crt is set without a value,
then the height of the terminal screen stored in the system
is used to compute the threshold (see
<I>stty</I>(1)).
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>DEAD</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
The name of the file to use

The default MIME encoding to use
in outgoing text messages and message parts.
Valid values are <I>8bit</I> or <I>quoted-printable</I>.
The default is <I>8bit</I>.
In case the mail transfer system

<I>quoted-printable</I> should be used instead.
If there is no need to encode a message,
<I>7bit</I> transfer mode is used,
without regard to the value of this variable.
Binary data is always encoded in <I>base64</I> mode.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>

</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>folder</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
The name of the directory to use
for storing folders of messages.
If this name begins with a &#39;/&#39;,
<I>nail</I> considers it to be an absolute pathname;
otherwise, the folder directory is found
relative to your home directory.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>from</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
The address to put into the <I>&#39;From:&#39;</I> field of the message header.
If replying to a message,
this address is handled as if it were in the alternates list.
If this variable is set,
a <I>&#39;Sender:&#39;</I> field containing the user&#39;s name
is also generated,
unless the variable <I>smtp</I> is set
and its value differs from <I>localhost</I>.
If the machine&#39;s hostname is not valid at the Internet
(for example at a dialup machine),
you have to set this variable
or
<I>hostname</I> to get correct Message-ID header fields.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>hostname</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Use this string as hostname

Is used as the user&#39;s mailbox, if set.
Otherwise, a system-dependent default is used.
Can be a
<I>protocol</I><B>://</B>
string (see the
<B>folder</B> command for more information).
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>MAILX_HEAD</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
A string to put at the beginning of each new message.
The escape sequences &#39;<B>&#92;t</B>&#39; (tabulator) and &#39;<B>&#92;n</B>&#39; (newline)

</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>NAIL_EXTRA_RC</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
The name of an optional startup file
to be read after ~/.mailrc.
This variable is ignored if it is imported from the environment;
it has an effect only if it is set in /etc/nail.rc or ~/.mailrc
to allow bypassing the configuration with e. g. &#39;MAILRC=/dev/null&#39;.
Use this file for
<I>nail</I> commands
that are not understood by other mailx implementations.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>ORGANIZATION</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
The value to put into the <I>&#39;Organization:&#39;</I> field of the message header.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>PAGER</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
Pathname of the program to use
in the more command
or when crt variable is set.
The default paginator
<I>pg</I>(1)
or, in BSD compatibility mode,
<I>more</I>(1)
is used
if this option is not defined.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>password-</B><I>user</I><B>@</B><I>host</I>
</TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Set the password for
<I>user</I> when connecting to
<I>host</I>. If no such variable is defined for a host,
the user will be asked for a password on standard input.
Specifying passwords in a startup file
is generally a security risk,
the file should be readable
by the invoking user only.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>pipe-</B><I>content/subcontent</I> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
When a MIME message part of
<I>content/subcontent</I> type is displayed or it is replied to,
its text is filtered through the value of this variable
interpreted as a shell command.
Special care must be taken when using such commands
as mail viruses may be distributed by this method;
if messages of type
<I>application/x-sh</I> were filtered through the shell, for example,
a message sender could easily execute arbitrary code
on the system
<I>nail</I> is running on.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>pop3-keepalive</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Many POP3 servers will close the connection
after a period of inactivity.
Setting this variable to a numeric
<I>value</I> greater than 0
causes a NOOP command to be sent each
<I>value</I> seconds if no other operation is performed.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>prompt</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
The string printed when a command is accepted.
Defaults to &#39;<B>?&nbsp;</B>&#39;,
or to &#39;<TT>amp;&nbsp;</TT>&#39; if the
<B>bsdcompat</B> variable is set.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>quote</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
If set, <I>nail</I> starts a replying message with the original message prefixed
by the value of the variable <I>indentprefix</I>.
Normally, a heading consisting of &#39;Fromheaderfield wrote:&#39; is printed
before the quotation.
If the string <I>noheading</I> is assigned to the <I>quote</I> variable,
this heading is omitted.
If the string <I>headers</I> is assigned,
the headers selected by the ignore/retain commands
are printed above the message body,
thus <I>quote</I> acts like an automatic ~m command then.
If the string <I>allheaders</I> is assigned,
all headers are printed above the message body,
thus <I>quote</I> acts like an automatic ~M command then.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>screen</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
When <I>nail</I> initially prints the message headers,
it determines the number to print
by looking at the speed of your terminal.
The faster your terminal, the more it prints.
This option overrides this calculation
and specifies how many message headers
you want printed.
This number is also used
for scrolling with the z command.
</TD></TR>
<TR valign=top><TD colspan=2>
<B>sendmail</B> </TD></TR><TR valign=top><TD width=6%>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
To use an alternate mail delivery system,

<TR valign=top><TD width=6% nowrap>
<B>smtp</B> </TD><TD valign=bottom>
Normally, <I>nail</I> invokes
<I>sendmail</I>(8)
directly to transfer messages.
If <I>smtp</I> is set, a SMTP connection to
the server specified by the value of this variable
is used instead.
If the SMTP server does not use the standard port,
a value of <I>server:port</I> can be given,
with <I>port</I> as a name or as a number.

    <H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; POP3 client setup</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
First, you need the following data from your ISP:
the host name of its POP3 server,
user name and password for this server,
and a notice whether the server uses SSL/TLS encryption.
Assuming the host name is &#39;server.myisp.example&#39;
and your user name for that server is &#39;myname&#39;,
you can refer to this account using the
<I>folder</I> command or
<I>-f</I> command line option with
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>pop3://</B><I>myname</I><B>@</B><I>server.myisp.example</I>
<P>
</PRE>
(replace &#39;pop3://&#39; with &#39;pop3s://&#39; if the server supports SSL/TLS).
The string is not necessarily the same as your internet mail address.
As you probably want messages to be deleted from this account
after saving them,
prefix it with &#39;<I>%:</I>&#39;.
The
<I>shortcut</I> command can be used to avoid typing that many characters
every time you want to connect:
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>shortcut </B><I>myisp</I><B> </B><B>%:pop3://</B><I>myname</I><B>@</B><I>server.myisp.example</I>
<P>
</PRE>
You probably want to put this string into a startup file.
As the
<I>shortcut</I> command is
<I>nail-</I>specific and will confuse other
<I>mailx</I> implementations,
it should not be used in
<I>~/.mailrc</I>, instead, put
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set NAIL_EXTRA_RC=</B><I>~/.nailrc</I>
<P>
</PRE>
in
<I>~/.mailrc</I> and create a file
<I>~/.nailrc</I> containing the
<I>shortcut</I> command above.
<I>Nail</I> will ask you for a password string
each time you connect to this account.
If you can reasonably trust the security
of the machine you are working on,
you can give this password in the startup file as
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set password-</B><I>myname</I><B>@</B><I>server.myisp.example</I><B>="</B><I>SECRET</I><B>"</B>
<P>
</PRE>
You should change the permissions of this file to 0600, see
<I>chmod</I>(1).
Many POP3 servers will close the connection
after a short period of inactivity. Use
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>set pop3-keepalive=</B><I>30</I>
<P>
</PRE>
to send a keepalive message each 30 seconds.
If you encounter problems connecting to a SSL/TLS server,
try the
<I>ssl-rand-egd</I> and
<I>ssl-rand-file</I> variables (see the OpenSSL FAQ for more information)
or specify the protocol version with
<I>ssl-method</I>. Contact your ISP
if you need a client certificate
or if verification of the server certificate fails.
If the failed certificate is indeed valid,
fetch it by executing
<PRE>
<P>
&nbsp;   <B>openssl s_client -connect </B><I>server.myisp.example</I><B>:</B><I>pop3s</I>
<P>
</PRE>
(see
<I>s_client</I>(1))
and put it into the file specified with
<I>ssl-ca-file</I>. </BLOCKQUOTE>

     <H3>NOTES</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Variables in the environment passed to
<I>nail</I> cannot be unset.
<P>
The character set conversion relies heavily
on the
<I>iconv</I>(3)
function.
Its functionality differs widely
between the various system environments
<I>nail</I> runs on.
<P>
Nail expects input text to be in Unix format,
with lines separated by
<I>newline</I> (^J, &#92;n) characters only.
Non-Unix text files that use
<I>carriage return</I> (^M, &#92;r)
characters in addition will be treated as binary data;
to send such files as text, strip these characters e.&nbsp;g. by

POP3 mailboxes are limited in some ways:
It is not possible to edit messages,
they can only be copied and deleted.
The line count for the header display
is only appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded
from the server.
The status field of a message is maintained by the server
between connections;
some servers do not update it at all,
and with a server that does,
the &#39;exit&#39; command will not cause the message status to be reset.
The &#39;newmail&#39; command and the &#39;newmail&#39; variable
have no effect.
An unencrypted POP3 message download
can be interrupted from the terminal,
but the part that was not downloaded
will have to be downloaded
before the next command is sent.
A SSL/TLS encrypted POP3 message download
should not be interrupted,
as this will very likely cause an error in the SSL transport.
<P>
There is no support for SSL/TLS certificate revocation lists (CRLs) yet.

A <I>mail</I> command appeared in Version 1 A&amp;T Unix.
Berkeley Mail was written in 1978 by Kurt Shoens.
This man page is derived from
from The Mail Reference Manual
originally written by Kurt Shoens.
A revision for <I>nail</I> was done by Gunnar Ritter.
