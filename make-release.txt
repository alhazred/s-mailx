Appendix
^^^^^^^^

The complete changelog of commits in between two versions OLD and
NEW can be inspected by using the git(1) `log' command:

  $ git log --reverse --topo-order --abbrev-commit OLD..NEW
  # Only topic branch headers (--no-merges for content commits only):
  $ git log --oneline --reverse --topo-order --merges OLD..NEW
  # Same, but truly accessible:
  $ git log --oneline --reverse --topo-order --merges --parents OLD..NEW |
    while read c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6; do
      printf "%-24s: \$ git log --oneline --no-merges %s ^%s\n" \
        "${c6}" "${c1}" "${c2}";
    done

Entries for releases before v14.9.0 have been cut off and can be
found in the git(1) repository:

  v14.8.0 - v14.8.16: $ git show v14.8.16:NEWS
  v13     - v14.8.5 : $ git show v14.8.5:NEWS
  9.0     - 12.5    : $ git show heirloom:ChangeLog

Also accessible via HTTPS?, just replace X.Y.Z accordingly:

  \https?://git.sdaoden.eu/cgit/s-nail.git/tree/NEWS?h=vX.Y.Y

For even older releases you need to look into the [timeline]
branch, but no changelog has been administrated for them.
