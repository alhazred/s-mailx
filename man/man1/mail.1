NAME              mail -- send mail to another user

SYNOPSIS          mail [ letter person ... ]

DESCRIPTION       mail without an argument searches for a file called
                  mailbox, prints it if present, asks if it should be saved.
                  If the answer is y , the mail is renamed mail, otherwise
                  it is deleted. The answer to the above question may be
                  supplied in the letter argument.

                  When followed by the names of a letter and one or more
                  people, the letter is appended to each person's mailbox.
                  Each letter is preceded by the sender's name and a
                  postmark.

                  A person is either the name of an entry in the directory
                  /usr, in which case the mail is sent to
                  /usr/person/mailbox, or the path name of a directory, in
                  which case mailbox in that directory is used.

                  When a user logs in he is informed of the presence of
                  mail.

FILES             /etc/uids to map the sender's numerical user ID to name;
                  mail and mailbox in various directories.

DIAGNOSTICS       "Who are you?" if the user cannot be identified for some
                  reason (a bug). "Cannot send to user" if mailbox cannot be
                  opened.
