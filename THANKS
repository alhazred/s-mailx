S-nail is maintained and developed by Steffen Nurpmeso.  It is
based upon Heirloom mailx (formerly nail) which was developed by
Gunnar Ritter and which was itself based upon Berkeley Mail that
originates in 2BSD (Kurt Shoens (UCB) March 25, 1978).

Other people contributed by reporting problems, suggesting various
improvements or submitting actual code.  Here is a list of those
people.  I hope the list is complete and free of errors.
