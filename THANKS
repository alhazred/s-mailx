This document contains the contributors to nail. I very much regret
that it seems impossible to include the people that contributed
within the more than twenty years of history of BSD Mail.

Alexey A. Shelkovich sent a core file to fix an illustrous null pointer.

Anders Andersson helped by compiling on FreeBSD.

Bob Tennent sent some Red Hat patches and gave some important hints
	about the world-writeability of mail spool directories.
