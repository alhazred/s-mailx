v14.9.0 ("Long-tailed tit"), 2017-05-??
---------------------------------------

  Preview 4, 2017-04-13(+55min):
  This is not a release candidate because some functionality is
  missing still:
  - the ~^ command escape needs new subcommands remove-at and
    remove-addrs, so that, e.g., the new *alternates* variable
    list can be manually removed with a single command.
  - the command escapes must learn to manage $? and $!.
  - also, i want a `-' command modifier for command escapes, in
    equal spirit to the new `ignerr' command modifier, so that,
    e.g., "~-:noSuchCommand" will effectively be "ignerr
    noSuchCommand" and thus not exit even with *ignerr* set.
    The interaction of *errexit* and command escapes is not yet
    proper.  (And i hope the `-' is known from `make', sigh.)
  - disable all MIME handlers which do not integrate into normal
    output, i.e., are not "copiuous" output.  This of course
    requires a new `mimeview' or similar command, and this is
    a problem: we have it all, but the code paths have nothing in
    common.  But i will not ship 14.9.0 with the current,
    completely unrestricted MIME handlers enabled.
  - try (hard) to reinstantiate IMAP.

  + If you tried something with -pre3, and it did not work: please
    try again!

This is a major feature release which took about ~19 months (21
less two) of development to complete, and which imposed massive
changes under the hood, but also quite a lot of user visible
changes, including some **backward incompatibilities**.

It brings noticeable improvements regarding scriptability and its
reliability, but also for interactive use cases, especially
notable to users is our completely new M(ailx)L(ine)E(ditor) that
supports rather real tabulator expansion and program-mode-context-
sensitive key bindings.

We now support macros with arguments, which can be `shift'ed,
a `return' status can be used, and a `vexpr' multiplexer offers
some arithmetic and string operations.  `commandalias'es are
recursive, further command modifier prefixes, like `ignerr', give
a hand that we otherwise could not offer.  In compose-mode the new
`~^' command escape allows some message and attachment access, and
can be used, e.g., to implement things like custom headers, and
has been especially designed for scripted access via the new
*on-compose-splice* and *on-compose-splice-shell* hooks.  

S-nail will move (more or less) backward-incompatibly to sh(1)ell
compatible argument quoting (documented in "COMMANDS"), and an
increasing number of commands do support this already: new ones
exclusively, some old ones have either been switched (like
`localopts'), others -- noticeably `set' -- can be switched to the
new syntax with a `wysh' command modifier prefix.  E.g.:

  ? define __xv {
     localopts yes; wysh set verbose; ignerr eval "${@}"; return $?
  }
  ? commandalias call echo boo-boo
  ? commandalias xv call __xv
  ? xv list
  ? wysh ghost xv '\'call __xv
  ? xv list

Calling this `xv' for `list' will give more detailed command
information, including which kind of argument is used.

I have not managed to implement the three features i have started
this development cycle for, these are thus subject to further
development, just like wysh for message-list argument commands to
support, e.g., negation, and wysh for `if' and consorts.

NOTES, ChangeLog (packager-affine)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* This release brings some backward incompatibilities, outlined
  in the following.

* The configuration and build system has changed:

  o Anything which was WANT_xy before is now OPT_xy, and
    compiled-in paths and values, like PREFIX or PAGER, have
    gained a VAL_ prefix (thus VAL_PREFIX and VAL_PAGER).

    This is _not_ true for non-persistent or environmental values,
    e.g., DESTDIR, CC, etc, and also not for the overwritable
    program variables during configuration, e.g., $awk.

  o SENDMAIL -> VAL_MTA, SENDMAIL_PROGNAME -> VAL_MTA_ARGV0,
    MAILSPOOL -> VAL_MAIL.
    And VAL_NAIL -> VAL_MAILX, though this is still a lie.

  o The make system now needs config..build..install or
    all..install or tangerine (config..build..test..install).

  o The `build' phase can be parallelized by setting the $MAKEJOBS
    environment variable, e.g., "make MAKEJOBS=-j4 build".
    Note this variable is not tracked in the configuration.
    (Gaetan Bisson)

  o Set the new OPT_CROSS_BUILD to avoid feature runtime tests,
    only compile- and link-availability will be tested.  (Juan RP)

  o VERBOSE is implemented straight, but must be given at
    configuration time in order to become honoured.
    (William Yodlowsky)

  o ADDCFLAGS / ADDLDFLAGS -> EXTRA_CFLAGS / EXTRA_LDFLAGS.

  o The LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc. building processes will skip any path
    which contains the string "fakeroot".  (Hilko Bengen)

  o We honour a set $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH#? environment variable.
    (reproducible-builds.org; Colin Watson)

    For reproducability of error messages, the new *log-prefix*
    variable can be set.

  o These are upward compatible changes.

  o "make OPENSSL_API_COMPAT=0x10100000 all" should work.

- To support RFC 1524 a.k.a. .mailcap files (see below) many
  "trigger"-characters have been added for *pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE*#?,
  which may (rarely) affect existing values.
  The .mailcap support itself is not yet implemented.

- *NAIL_{HEAD,TAIL}* have been obsoleted in favour of
  *message-inject-head*#? and *message-inject-tail*#?.

- *NAIL_HIST{FILE,SIZE}* have been obsoleted in favour of
  *history-file*#? and *history-size*#?.

- -H#? and -L#? have been decoupled:
   it used to be -e#? -L#? instead!

- Colour support has been changed backward in- and upward (from
  user interface side) compatibly, see the manual section
  "Coloured display"#?.

  + New commands: `colour'#? and `uncolour'#?.
    You can define context-sensitive, terminal-capability-
    sensitive settings, e.g.:

      if terminal && [ "$features" @= +colour ]
        colour iso  view-header ft=bold,fg=magenta,bg=cyan
        colour 256  view-header ft=bold,fg=208,bg=230 subject,from
        colour mono view-header ft=bold
        colour mono view-header ft=bold,ft=reverse subject,from
      endif

  + The variable *colour-pager*#? defines whether colour and font
    attribute sequences should be generated when viewing something
    in $PAGER#?.

  + Set the variable *colour-disable*#? to turn colour off
    without affecting established settings.

  + It is deduced via termcap(5) (see below) whether the terminal
    supports colors, e.g., "s-nail -Stermcap=Co#256".
    This is also true if we don't have termcap support.

  + Support for 256-colour terminals. (Gavin Troy)

- `source'#? series support shell pipes if the last character
   of the "filename" ends with a vertical bar |, e.g.,

      ? source 'gpg -qd ~/.s-nailrc-private.gpg |'

- Shell pipes are also supported as targets for `move'#?,
  `copy'#? etc., e.g.,

      ? copy . '| cat; echo huhu'

- Support for custom headers via the new ~^#? compose-mode
  command escape and in addition, or alternatively, with the
  internal variable *customhdr*#?, which can be covered by
  `localopts'#?.
  (Sergey Matveev)

  + Support of $ORGANIZATION has been dropped.

  + In compose mode ~e#? supports _any_ header.

  + In compose mode ~^#? supports _any_ header.

- New -:#? command line option can be used to more easily select
  which startup files should be loaded, e.g., -:/ loads none.
  (Robert Elz)

- `account'#?s and *folder-hook*#?s now have `localopts'#?
   enabled by default.

- A first simple form of compose-mode hooks has been implemented:
  *on-compose-enter*#? and *on-compose-leave*#? can be set to
  macros which get invoked at appropriate times, with
  `localopts'#? enabled (which extend until the message is sent).

  An even more powerful mechanism is available via the also new
  *on-compose-splice* and *on-compose-splice-shell* hooks, e.g.,
  (Jens Schleusener, Rudolf Sykora)

    ? set on-compose-splice=ocs
    ? define ocs {
      read ver
      echo Splice protocol version is $ver
      echo '~^header list'
      read hl; vput vexpr es substr "${hl}" 0 1
      if [ "$es" != 2 ]
        echoerr 'Failed to read header list, bailing out'; echo '~x'
      end
      if [ "$hl" !@ ' cc' ]
        echo '~^header insert cc Diet is your <mirr.or>'
        read es; vput vexpr es substr "${es}" 0 1
        if [ "$es" != 2 ]
          echoerr 'Failed to insert Cc:, bailing out'; echo '~x'
        end
      end
    }

- "The .netrc file"#?

  + gained support for comments.
    (Walter Alejandro Iglesias, Ralph Corderoy)

  + `netrc'#? now has a "load" subcommand.

  + the new *netrc-pipe*#? obsoletes OPT_AGENT and
    *agent-shell-lookup*, and can be used to load an encrypted
    .netrc file, e.g.:

      ? set netrc-lookup netrc-pipe='gpg -qd ~/.netrc.gpg'

    E.g., this is in usual .netrc syntax and thus possibly much
    nicer than saying "source 'gpg -qd ~/.credentials.gpg |'".

- termcap(5) / terminfo(5) support has been changed backward in-
  and upward (from user interface side) compatibly, please read
  "On terminal control and line editor"#?

  + OPT_TERMCAP is by default enabled.
    The new, by default enabled, configuration option
    OPT_TERMCAP_VIA_TERMINFO can be used to (try to) use
    terminfo(5) instead.

  + The variable *termcap*#? can be used to freely define or
    override terminal capabilities, and *termcap-disable*#? will
    disable interaction with the chosen library, leaving only
    *termcap* in charge.

  + The builtin line editor has been rather completely rewritten
    to be the Mailx-Line-Editor (OPT_MLE, default yes), and
    supports wide glyphs (if possible), infinite line lengths
    (2 GB) and more.  Tabulator expansion is no longer an option
    (but needs fnmatch(3)).

  + Optionally (OPT_KEY_BINDINGS, default yes) it has become
    possible to freely define key bindings for the MLE via the new
    `bind'#?  and `unbind'#? commands.  These key bindings can
    make use of termcap(5) and/or terminfo(5) names.  The MLE will
    install a set of default bindings, more so with OPT_TERMCAP,
    try "bind*".

    Sufficient support provided, one can now, e.g., type "p " and
    then collect the message numbers to type, scrolling forward
    and backward via key-bindings, without loosing the line
    content, then commit the final line.

  + OPT_EDITLINE and OPT_READLINE support have been dropped.
    The new MLE should not miss anything.  Does it?
    Tip: in an UTF-8 locale try "touch /tmp/hall{,öchen}" and then
    autocomplete that: once, then ^Q, and again.

- `source'#? can be used in `call'#?ed macros.
  What sounds so innocent replaced an entire machinery and got rid
  of a brilliant idea of Kurt Shoens from the 70s, but which never
  worked with Nail/Heirloom extensions, namely macros, and in
  right order.
  Accompanying this -X#? can be used to define macros and run
  them etc.  Should work:

    $ s-nail -X'define x {' -Xversion -Xx -X'}' -X'call x'
    $ s-nail -X'source \' -X'"echo version|"' -Xx

- Internal and environment variables are now explicitly _defined_
  and _tracked_ after variable handling has been rewritten
  completely.

  + Notes:
    o This means that, e.g., "password=NOT_SECRET s-nail" will
      **NOT** work no more, since *password*#? is an internal
      variable!

    o But if you do, e.g., "set TMPDIR=~/tmp", then this will
      also be reflected in the program environment (it is an
      environment variable) and thus affect child processes.

    o Therefore we no longer have `setenv' and `unsetenv'.

    o To integrate any other environment variable transparently
      into our variable management, the new command `environ'#?
      needs to be used, e.g., "environ set NEWVAR=value" or
      "environ link EXISTINGVAR".

  + -u#? / $LOGNAME#? ($USER) handling has been redefined,
    and "-u USER" is now exactly the same as "-f %USER", and
    $LOGNAME (and $USER) is actively set to the active user.
    (Afan)

    $LOGNAME#? is POSIX standardized and henceforth used and
    preferred over $USER, which came from BSD.  (Todd C. Miller)

- In the future (at least non-message-list) argument handling will
  be changed backward-incompatibly to be sh(1)ell compatible (and
  thus POSIX standardized), see "Shell-style argument quoting"#?.
  New commands use it already today (`bind'#?, `colour'#?,
  `headerpick'#?), some others (most importantly, `set'#?) can
  be forced to do so via the new `wysh' command prefix, as in:

    ? wysh set message-inject-tail=$'\n--steffen'
    ? bind base $'\cA,\x61' 'echo control-A and small a'

- We now actively manage *umask*#?: 0077 by default, but an
  empty string will use the setting that is active upon startup.
  Just like changes to (known) environment variables, this setting
  will also be inherited by any child process.
  (Walter Alejandro Iglesias)

- Anything SENDMAIL / *sendmail*-ish has been renamed to *mta*#?,
  *mta-arguments*#?, *mta-no-default-arguments*#? and
  *mta-argv0*#?.

  The reason is that in v15 we won't even have *smtp*: it is just
  another form of MTA, and thus obsolete by itself.
  Note that *mta-arguments* is now parsed via the shell-token
  parser, so the following ends up exactly as desired.

    ? wysh set mta-arguments='-t -X "/tmp/my log"'

  For now we support a hack that understands a file:// URL in
  *mta*, too, but that is also the default if there is no protocol.
  E.g.: "set mta=smtp://a:b@xy.z"

- The "spamd" *spam-interface*#? is obsolete.  I haven't tested
  it since my main machine died, it is error prone since it assumes
  internals of the spamassassin wire protocol, and there never was
  a speed improvement over "spamc".  (However it could react upon
  the "is-spam" state of a message, which "spamc" doesn't allow.)

- The new *inbox*#? variable will henceforth be looked up when
  searching for a primary system mailbox (as in "File %"),
  followed by the usual $MAIL#? and compile-time mailspool
  search.  (Stephen Isard, Jürgen Daubert)

- New "failinvaddr" keyword for *expandaddr*#?.

- We finally "can" the so-called (by myself) "Dr. Problem" (a bit):
  (Dr. Werner Fink)

    $ echo|./s-nail -:/ -sTrödel -dSencoding=8bit \
      'Dr. Diet Curd <to@fu.soj>' 2>&1|\
    grep To:
    s-nail: >>> To: "Dr. Diet Curd" <to@fu.soj>

  This can be done via the new `addrcodec'#?, too:

    $ echo 'addrcodec e Dr. Diet <to@fu.soj> Curd'|./s-nail -#:/
    "Dr. Diet Curd" <to@fu.soj>

- All commands with the string "codec" in their name use different
  argument quoting, namely none at all, read "Raw data arguments
  for codec commands"#?.

- We gained "Command modifiers"#?: `\'#? (avoid `commandalias'#?
  expansion), `vput'#? (store result in variable), `ignerr'#?
  (ignore an error of the following command, even if the new
  *errexit*#? is set), `wysh'#? (use shell-style arguments).

    $ echo 'vput cwd resvar;echo $resvar' | ./s-nail -#:/
    /home/steffen/src/nail.git

  And the usual sh(1) stuff: `return'#?, `shift'#?, `eval'#?,
  plus a `xcall'#? stack-avoidance optimization.
  And an "expr(1) like thing": `vexpr'#?.

    $ echo 'vexpr + 1 2' | ./s-nail -#:/
    00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000011
    03 | 0x3 | 3
    $ echo 'vput vexpr resvar + 1 2;echo $resvar' | ./s-nail -#:/
    3

  We actually start walking (?#?, *^*#?).

    ? vput vexpr res regex 'bananarama' 'Bana(.+)' '\$1\$0'
    ? echo $?/$^ERRNAME :$res:
    1/NODATA ::
    ? vput vexpr res iregex 'bananarama' '(.+)rama' '\$1\$0'
    ? echo $?/$^ERRNAME :$res:
    0/NONE :bananabananarama:

- `if'#? no longer performs automatic number conversion, we
  use the explicit -lt, -gt syntax of the sh(1).
  Note: `if' will change to be almost identical to sh(1) if(1),
  so please ensure proper bracket quoting, even if it is less
  convenient.

ChangeLog
^^^^^^^^^

- The manual has seen another major overhaul, all the variables
  are now documented in a single, sorted list, and many
  clarifications should have been added.  I hope it has become
  a better read.
  (Predrag Punosevac, Michael Convey, Hariskar, Rudolf Sykora,
  Respiranto, Thomas Dickey, Donald Mugnai)

- *mime-counter-evidence*#? gained bit 4 (perform proper in-depth
  content inspection as necessary; set to 0xE for all bits).
  (Aharon Robbins)

- Maildir paths are now created recursively as necessary.
  (Justin Ellingwood)

- -M#? and -m#? options have been added to enforce a special
  send mode that will flag standard input / the given file with
  the specified / detected MIME 'Content-Type:'.  This can be used
  to directly send, e.g., HTML log output.  Note that before v15
  this is quite restricted: you are not free to do anything.
  (Viktro Szépe, Ralph Corderoy)

- Disallow symlinks on writable files (O_NOFOLLOW open(2)).
  (Matthew Dillon)

- `retain'#?, `ignore'#? etc. now differentiate in between
  From (the From: header) and From_ (the MBOX ident).

- In fact we now have a new `headerpick'#? command which
  is a multiplexer for all retain and ignore lists used, call it
  without arguments to see the current setting of them all.
  In v15 only `headerpick' and the standard-imposed wrappers
  `retain' and `ignore' will remain, all other wrappers will
  vanish.  Regular expressions can now be used if available:

    0[ich /var/spool/mail/steffen]? headerpick
    headerpick type retain add blahblahblah cc date from \
      mail-followup-to message-id openpgp reply-to subject to \
      user-agent
    #headerpick type ignore currently covers no fields
    #headerpick save retain currently covers no fields
    headerpick save ignore add '^Original-.*$' '^X-.*$'
    headerpick forward retain add cc date from list-id \
      mail-followup-to reply-to subject to openpgp
    #headerpick forward ignore currently covers no fields

- `top'#? has been rewritten completely, `Top'#? is new.
  It uses a builtin set of retain/ignore headers, but it is
  possible to register a custom set via `headerpick'#?.
  Also, *toplines*#? has been extended a bit and the new
  *topsqueeze*#? variable may pimp your `top' experience.

    ? headerpick top retain add subject
    ? top
    [-- Message  1 -- 87 lines, 4791 bytes --]:
    Subject: Re: I can't dist to myself

    I wrote:
        3.22. bounce_delivered

- `features' has been dropped, `version'#? extended.

- The *prompt*#? handling has changed: we lost the capability to
  expand \?, \@ and \$, instead new "private" variables *?*#?,
  *account-name*#?, *mailbox-resolved*#?  and
  *mailbox-display*#? have been introduced, and the prompt
  is completely shell expanded (thus twice with `wysh' or in v15),
  as if dollar-single-quote quoted.  We do support the reverse-
  solidus escaped bracket notation for embedding characters which
  should not be counted when calculating the width of the prompt.
  The `colour'#? command has a slot for the prompt colour.
  We gained *prompt2*#? as a second level prompt.

    ? var prompt
    ? wysh set prompt='?\${?}[\${account} \${mailbox-display}]? '

- The filename "-" can be used as a receiver, e.g.,

    echo 'From Blödel'|s-nail -:/ -Sexpandaddr -Sencoding=8b -sUB -

- The -s#? command line option, the ~s#? command escape
  as well as the corresponding slots of ~^#? will actively
  strip [\r\n] from their value (Debian #419840).

- New `read'#? and `echoerr'#? commands, mostly for
  *on-compose-splice*#?.
  But also `echon'#? and `echoerrn'#?, which don't write
  a trailing newline.

- New variable *r-option-implicit*#? may be helpful to those
  who regulary need the functionality of the -r#? command
  line option.  (Felipe Gasper, Martin Neitzel)

- By using new "pseudo-URLs" one can automatize the use of S/MIME
  keys / (certificates / intermediate include certificates) with
  passwords.  E.g., to drive bob@exam.ple, set
  *smime-sign-cert-bob@exam.ple* to the private key / certificate
  pair as usual, the password lookup will then be performed for
  bob@exam.ple.smime-cert-key, bob@exam.ple.smime-cert-cert and
  bob@exam.ple.smime-include-certs.
  Like this the password can be stored in an encrypted .netrc file
  when *netrc-lookup*#? and *netrc-pipe*#? are set, or it may
  be stored in an encrypted resource file that has been loaded via
  `source'#? as a simple *password*#? variable.

  Note that the prompting that happens as a last resort will still
  interfere with a possibly running $PAGER#? instance, dependent
  on the setting of *crt*#?, of course.  Proper job control
  handling and recognizing that we are running $PAGER when doing
  that prompt is a TODO for v15.  Sorry.

- Some commands, like `set'#?, `help'#?, `list'#?,
  `mlist'#? etc., now react upon the setting of *verbose*#?
  and(/or) *debug*#?.

- `write'#? uses iconv(3) as appropriate.

- *mbox-rfc4155*#? has first been dropped, and then
  reintroduced with different semantics.  Because, it can be
  helpful if a messed up MBOX is read: by setting it, reopening
  the MBOX, unsetting it again and then doing "copy * SOMEWHERE"
  we will ensure the new SOMEWHERE is a valid MBOX.

- `call_if'#? is new; kept it even after "ignerr call" came up.

- The new *smime-ca-flags*#? and *ssl-ca-flags*#? can be used
  to fine-tune X509_STORE_set_flags(3).  (In the following, the
  first `wysh' enables the ';' to be recognized as a shell token
  delimiter, the second allows shell-style expansion of the
  variable value.)

    ? wysh set ssl-ca-flags=partial-chain;\
      wysh set smime-ca-flags="${ssl-ca-flags}"

- Socket connections use TLS S(erver)N(ame)I(ndication) as
  appropriate (RFC 7817).

- A new `charsetalias'#? command.  (Pietro Cerutti, mutt#3925)

Appendix
^^^^^^^^

The complete changelog of commits in between two versions OLD and
NEW can be inspected by using the git(1) `log' command:

  $ git log --reverse --topo-order --abbrev-commit OLD..NEW
  # Only topic branch headers (--no-merges for content commits only):
  $ git log --oneline --reverse --topo-order --merges OLD..NEW
  # Same, but truly accessible:
  $ git log --oneline --reverse --topo-order --merges --parents OLD..NEW |
    while read c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6; do
      printf "%-24s: \$ git log --oneline --no-merges %s ^%s\n" \
        "${c6}" "${c1}" "${c2}";
    done

Entries for the S-nail releases before v14.9.0 have been cut off
before release v14.9.0 and can be found in the git(1) repository:

  v14.8.0 - v14.8.16: $ git show v14.8.16:NEWS
  v13     - v14.8.5 : $ git show v14.8.5:NEWS
  9.0     - 12.5    : $ git show heirloom:ChangeLog

Also accessible via the HTTPS?, just replace X.Y.Z accordingly:

For even older releases you need to look into the [timeline]
branch, but no changelog has been administrated for them.
