v14.9.2 ("Crested tit"), 2017-08-01
-----------------------------------

This is a bugfix release but which ships some improvements, too.
It silently replaces v14.9.1 from yesterday, which was broken.

NOTES, ChangeLog (packager-affine)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- fakeroot support was blindly taken from Debian and broken.
  (Gavin Troy, Gaetan Bisson)

ChangeLog
^^^^^^^^^

- In compose mode the MLE allows empty lines again.

- We no longer require a writable $HOME#561.  Due to false code
  flow (but but but: with correct comment) a non-writable $HOME
  entry in /etc/password (i.e., from getpwuid(3)) would lead to
  a crash.  (Felix Fontain; Ralph Corderoy)

- Two faulty string operations slipped into the IMAP code,
  resulting in a crash and a "is-same-host" test that would fail
  for IMAPS connections like `save'#244 or `copy'#147 because of an
  implicit IMAP protocol for the target of those operations (thus
  IMAP != IMAPS).  (Paul Vojta)

- The MLE tab-expansion will now automatically append a "/" if
  there is only one possible expansion and that is a directory,
  saving the user one <TAB>.  (Christos Zoulas)

- New `~I'#307 command escape is like `~i'#308 but does not append
  a newline.

- `localopts'#197 gained an optional second argument.
  It is now possible to specify that any macro `call'#133ed
  will have localopts enabled, and it is possible to fixate the
  setting so that it cannot be reverted.

- *@*#331 should now act completely compatible to the sh(1)ell,
  thus obsoleting my hysteric warnings in the v14.9.0 announcement.

- The `Lreply'#198, `reply'#232, `Reply'#231 series as well as
  `mail'#200 now manage the error status *!*#325.
  I.e., there are now errors like *^ERR*#327-DESTADDRREQ,
  ^ERR-NODATA, ^ERR-PERM and similar.  It is not perfect yet,
  because $DEAD#559 may have been written (with *save*#483) or not,
  for example.

  `Lreply' and `reply' have been rewritten rather completely
  indeed.  They join Reply-To: and Mail-Followup-To: dependent on
  the context (i.e., *reply-to-honour*#481, *followup-to-honour*#391,
  see "Mailing lists"#10 for the picture), and if they did, use
  this list as the receivers exclusively.  It now honours
  *recipients-in-cc*#474 even for such addressees.  (And now i wonder
  whether i should have credited Paul Vojta for that.)

  Also `Lreply' would have crashed for mails with Reply-To: but
  without *reply-to-honour*#481 set.  We now have a test.

v14.9.0 ("Long-tailed tit"), 2017-07-16
---------------------------------------

This is a major feature release which took about ~22 months (24
less two) of development to complete, and which imposed massive
changes under the hood, but also quite a lot of user visible
changes, including some **backward incompatibilities**.
As usual, "s-nail -d" will show obsoletion warnings.

We gain noticeable improvements regarding scriptability and its
reliability, but also for interactive use cases, especially
notable to users is our completely new M(ailx)L(ine)E(ditor) that
supports rather real tabulator expansion and program-mode-context-
sensitive key bindings.

We now support macros with arguments, which can be `shift'ed,
a `return' status can be used, and a `vexpr' multiplexer offers
some arithmetic and string operations.  `commandalias'es are
recursive, further command modifier prefixes, like `ignerr', give
a hand that we otherwise could not offer.  In compose-mode the new
`~^' command escape allows some message and attachment access, and
can be used, e.g., to implement things like custom headers, and
has been especially designed for scripted access via the new
*on-compose-splice* and *on-compose-splice-shell* hooks.

S-nail will move (more or less) backward-incompatibly to sh(1)ell
compatible argument quoting (documented in "COMMANDS"), and an
increasing number of commands do support this already: new ones
exclusively, some old ones have either been switched (like
`localopts'), others -- noticeably `set' -- can be switched to the
new syntax with a `wysh' command modifier prefix.  E.g.:

  ? define __xv {
    # Be careful to choose sh(1)ell-style on _entire_ line!
     localopts yes; wysh set verbose; ignerr eval "${@}"; return $?
    }
  ? commandalias call echo boo-boo
  ? commandalias xv call __xv
  ? xv list
  ? commandalias xv '\'call __xv
  ? xv list

Calling the latter `xv' for `list' will give more detailed command
information, including which kind of argument is used.

I have not managed to implement the three features i have started
this development cycle for, these are thus subject to further
development, just like wysh for message-list argument commands to
support, e.g., negation, wysh for `if' and consorts, the --
terminator to finally overcome the ridiculous requirement to quote
entire shell commands filenames for commands like `pipe.
And and and.

NOTES, ChangeLog (packager-affine)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* This release brings some backward incompatibilities, outlined
  in the following.  Most users will not be affected, and we have
  added a lot of compatibility cruft, but that will vanish in v15.
  "$ s-nail -v"!

* The configuration and build system has changed.
  Packagers have received updated package files.

  o Anything which was WANT_xy before is now OPT_xy, and
    compiled-in paths and values, like PREFIX or PAGER, have
    gained a VAL_ prefix (thus VAL_PREFIX and VAL_PAGER).

    This is _not_ true for non-persistent or environmental values,
    e.g., DESTDIR, CC, etc., and also not for the overwritable
    program variables during configuration, e.g., $awk.

  o SENDMAIL -> VAL_MTA, SENDMAIL_PROGNAME -> VAL_MTA_ARGV0,
    MAILSPOOL -> VAL_MAIL.
    And NAIL -> VAL_MAILX, though this is still a lie.

  o The make system now needs config..build..install or
    all..install or tangerine (config..build..test..install).
    Some constants which some experts may want to fine-tune have
    been moved to config.h.  Usual adjustments+doc via make.rc.

  o The `build' phase can be parallelized by setting the $MAKEJOBS
    environment variable, e.g., "make MAKEJOBS=-j4 build".
    Note this variable is not tracked in the configuration.
    (Gaetan Bisson)

  o Unless DESTDIR is set an uninstallation script will be
    installed along with the rest (see INSTALL file for more).

  o Set the new OPT_CROSS_BUILD to avoid feature runtime tests,
    only compile- and link-availability will be tested.  (Juan RP)

  o VERBOSE is implemented straight, but must be given at
    configuration time in order to become honoured.
    (William Yodlowsky)

  o ADDCFLAGS / ADDLDFLAGS -> EXTRA_CFLAGS / EXTRA_LDFLAGS.

  o The LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc. building processes will skip any path
    which contains the string "fakeroot".  (Hilko Bengen)

  o We honour a set $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH#578 environment variable to
    an extend that allows reproducible tests, which is why the
    repository gained a [test-out] branch with some expected plain
    text outputs.  (reproducible-builds.org; Colin Watson)

    The new *log-prefix*#417 variable aids in improving the
    reproducibility of error messages.

  o These are upward compatible changes.

* "make OPENSSL_API_COMPAT=0x10100000 all" should work.

* Internal and environment variables are now explicitly _defined_
  and _tracked_ after variable handling has been rewritten
  completely.  Notes:

  o This means that, e.g., "$ password=NOT_SECRET s-nail" will
    **NOT** work no more, since *password*#450 is an internal
    variable!

  o But if you do, e.g., "? set TMPDIR=~/tmp", then this will
    also be reflected in the program environment (it is an
    environment variable) and thus affect child processes.

  o Therefore we no longer have `setenv' and `unsetenv'.

  o To integrate any other environment variable transparently
    into our variable management, the new command `environ'#169
    needs to be used, e.g., "? environ set NEWVAR=value" or
    "? environ link EXISTINGVAR".

- -H#62 and -L#65 have been decoupled:
   it used to be -e#59 -L#65 instead!

- *NAIL_{HEAD,TAIL}* have been obsoleted in favour of
  *message-inject-head*#425 and *message-inject-tail*#426.

  *NAIL_HIST{FILE,SIZE}* have been obsoleted in favour of
  *history-file*#399 and *history-size*#402.

  *NAIL_EXTRA_RC* has been obsoleted in favour of
  *mailx-extra-rc*#420.

  *batch-exit-on-error* has been obsoleted by *errexit*#380, which
  works just like the POSIX sh(1)ell "set -e" construct; the
  `ignerr'#110 command modifier (`-' for command escapes in compose
  mode, and see below) can be used to ignore command errors even
  then.  (This will remain even if we at some later time will
  support at least some of the sh(1) constructs which "swallow"
  failures with set -e.)

  *bsdannounce* is obsolete, the feature is integrated in
  *header*#396 as this is much more useful.  (This is however also
  dependent upon the also new but well-known $POSIXLY_CORRECT#576
  <> *posix*#465, but that is just how it is; these affect more
  behaviour, and increasing.)

- Colour support has been changed backward in- and upward (from
  user interface side) compatibly, see the manual section
  "Coloured display"#17.

  + New commands: `colour'#142 and `uncolour'#143.
    You can define context-sensitive, terminal-capability-
    sensitive settings, e.g.:

      if terminal && [ "$features" =% +colour ]
        colour iso  view-header ft=bold,fg=magenta,bg=cyan
        colour 256  view-header ft=bold,fg=208,bg=230 subject,from
        colour mono view-header ft=bold
        colour mono view-header ft=bold,ft=reverse subject,from
      endif

  + The variable *colour-pager*#366 defines whether colour and font
    attribute sequences should be generated when viewing something
    in $PAGER#574.

  + Set the variable *colour-disable*#365 to turn colour off
    without affecting established settings.

  + It is deduced via termcap(5) (see below) whether the terminal
    supports colors, e.g., "$ s-nail -Stermcap=Co#256".
    This is also true if we don't have termcap support.

  + Support for 256-colour terminals. (Gavin Troy)

- `source'#259 series support shell pipes if the last character
   of the "filename" ends with a vertical bar |, e.g.,

      ? source 'gpg -qd ~/.s-nailrc-private.gpg |'

- Shell pipes are also supported as targets for `move'#210,
  `copy'#147 etc., yet unfortunately not with via a sh(1)ell token
  parser, so that the target still has to be a single argument.

      ? copy . '| cat; echo huhu'

- Support for custom headers via the new `~^'#323 compose-mode
  command escape and in addition, or alternatively, with the
  internal variable *customhdr*#370, which also can be covered by
  `localopts'#197.  (Sergey Matveev)

  + Support of $ORGANIZATION has been dropped.

  + Command escape `~e'#302 supports _any_ header.

  + Command escape `~^'#323 supports _any_ header.

- New -:#51 command line option can be used to more easily select
  which startup files should be loaded, e.g., -:/ loads none.
  (Robert Elz)

- `account'#122s and *folder-hook*#387s now have `localopts'#197
   enabled by default.

- A first simple form of compose-mode hooks has been implemented:
  *on-compose-enter*#443, *on-compose-leave*#444 and
  *on-compose-cleanup*#442 can be set to macros which get invoked
  at appropriate times.
  For the `resend'#236 series there is *on-resend-enter*#448 and
  *on-resend-cleanup*#447: this is very likely to change once
  true message access is possible even in this mode.

  An even more powerful mechanism is available via the also new
  *on-compose-splice*#445 and *on-compose-splice-shell*#446 hooks.
  These are executed in child processes and communicate with the
  parent via their standard input and output, and therefore can
  do anything and act as if they were the user.

  `localopts'#197 are enabled and cannot be disabled (and extend
  until the message is sent).
  (Jens Schleusener, Rudolf Sykora)

    ? set on-compose-splice=ocs
    ? define ocs {
      read ver
      echo Splice protocol version is $ver
      echo '~^header list'
      read hl; vput vexpr es substring "${hl}" 0 1
      if [ "$es" != 2 ]
        echoerr 'Failed to read header list, bailing out'
        echo '~x'
      elif [ "$hl" @i!% ' cc' ]
        echo '~^header insert cc Diet is your <mirr.or>'
        read es; vput vexpr es substr "${es}" 0 1
        if [ "$es" != 2 ]
          echoerr 'Failed to insert Cc:, bailing out'; echo '~x'
        end
      end
    }

- "The .netrc file"#36

  + gained support for comments.
    (Walter Alejandro Iglesias, Ralph Corderoy)

  + `netrc'#213 now has a "load" subcommand.

  + the new *netrc-pipe*#438 obsoletes OPT_AGENT and
    *agent-shell-lookup*, and can be used to load an encrypted
    .netrc file, e.g.:

      ? set netrc-lookup netrc-pipe='gpg -qd ~/.netrc.gpg'

    I.e., this is in usual .netrc syntax and thus possibly much
    nicer than saying "? source 'gpg -qd ~/.credentials.gpg |'".

- termcap(5) / terminfo(5) support has been changed backward in-
  and upward (from user interface side) compatibly, please read
  "On terminal control and line editor"#16.

  + OPT_TERMCAP is by default enabled.
    The new, by default enabled, configuration option
    OPT_TERMCAP_VIA_TERMINFO can be used to (try to) use
    terminfo(5) instead.

  + The variable *termcap*#541 can be used to freely define or
    override terminal capabilities, and *termcap-disable*#543 will
    disable interaction with the chosen library, leaving only
    *termcap* in charge.

    To use the so-called ca-mode on supporting terminals,
    effectively turning S-nail into a fullscreen application,
    *termcap-ca-mode*#542 must be set.

  + The built-in line editor has been rather completely rewritten
    to be the Mailx-Line-Editor (OPT_MLE, default yes), and
    supports wide glyphs (if possible), infinite line lengths
    (2 GB) and more.  Tabulator expansion is no longer an option
    (but needs fnmatch(3)).

  + Optionally (OPT_KEY_BINDINGS, default yes) it has become
    possible to freely define key bindings for the MLE via the new
    `bind'#131 and `unbind'#132 commands.  These key bindings can
    make use of termcap(5) and/or terminfo(5) names.  The MLE will
    install a set of default bindings (unless there is a set
    *line-editor-no-defaults*#416), more so with OPT_TERMCAP,
    i.e., try "? bind*".

    Sufficient support provided, one can now, e.g., type "p " and
    then collect the message numbers to type, scrolling forward
    and backward via key-bindings, without loosing the line
    content, then commit the final line.

  + OPT_EDITLINE and OPT_READLINE support have been dropped.
    The new MLE should not miss anything.  Does it?
    Tip: in an UTF-8 locale try "? !touch /tmp/hall{,öchen}" and
    then autocomplete that: once, then ^Q, and again.

- `source'#259 can be used in `call'#133ed macros.
  What sounds so innocent replaced an entire machinery and got rid
  of a brilliant idea of Kurt Shoens from the 70s, but which never
  worked with Nail/Heirloom extensions, namely macros, and in the
  right order.
  Accompanying this -X#79 can (dig multiline arguments and can) be
  used to define macros and run them etc.  Should work:

    $ s-nail -X'define x {' -Xversion -Xx -X'}' -X'call x'
    $ s-nail -X'source \' -X'"echo version|"' -Xx

  Macros can be `undefine'#152d from within themselves, and re-
  `define'#151d.  It is still not possible to define macros
  from within macros, and/or have inner macros, not to talk
  about local scoping or anything more sophisticated such.

- -u#76 / $LOGNAME#567 ($USER) handling has been redefined,
  and "-u USER" is now exactly the same as "-f %USER", and
  $LOGNAME (and $USER) is actively set to the active user.  (Afan)

  $LOGNAME#567 is POSIX standardized and henceforth used and
  preferred over $USER, which came from BSD.  (Todd C. Miller)

- In the future (at least non-message-list) argument handling will
  be changed backward-incompatibly to be sh(1)ell compatible (and
  thus POSIX standardized), see "Shell-style argument quoting"#23.
  New commands use it already today (`bind'#131, `colour'#142,
  `headerpick'#188), some others (most importantly, `set'#247) can
  be forced to do so via the new `wysh'#112 command prefix, as in:

    ? wysh set message-inject-tail=$'\n--steffen'
    ? bind base $'\cA,\x61' 'echo control-A and small a'

- We now actively manage *umask*#548: 0077 by default, but an
  empty string will use the setting that is active upon startup.
  Just like changes to (known) environment variables, this setting
  will also be inherited by any child process.
  (Walter Alejandro Iglesias)

- Anything SENDMAIL / *sendmail*-ish has been renamed to *mta*#433,
  *mta-arguments*#434, *mta-no-default-arguments*#435 and
  *mta-argv0*#436.

  The reason is that in v15 we won't even have *smtp*: it is just
  another form of MTA, and thus obsolete by itself.
  Note that *mta-arguments* is now parsed via the shell-token
  parser, so the following ends up exactly as desired.

    ? set mta-arguments='-t -X "/tmp/my log"'

  For now we support a hack that understands a file:// URL in
  *mta*, too, but that is also the default if there is no protocol.
  E.g.: "? set mta=smtp://a:b@xy.z"

- The "spamd" *spam-interface*#514 is obsolete.  I haven't tested
  it since my main machine died, it is error prone since it assumes
  internals of the spamassassin wire protocol, and there never was
  a speed improvement over "spamc".  (However it could react upon
  the "is-spam" state of a message, which "spamc" doesn't allow.)

- The new *inbox*#410 variable will henceforth be looked up when
  searching for a primary system mailbox (as in "? File %"),
  followed by the usual $MAIL#568 and compile-time defined local
  mailspool search.  (Stephen Isard, Jürgen Daubert)

- The semantic of -a#53 and `~@'#296 have been changed, and both
  commands now use the same syntax:

    -a file[=input-charset[#output-charset]]

- New "failinvaddr" keyword for *expandaddr*#382.

- We finally "can" the so-called (by myself) "Dr. Problem" (a bit):
  (Dr. Werner Fink)

    $ </dev/null s-nail -d:/ -sTrödler 'Dr. D. Iet <z@a.k>' 2>&1 |\
      grep To:
    s-nail: >>> To: "Dr. D. Iet" <z@a.k>

  This can be done via the new `addrcodec'#124, too, note this
  supports multiple modes (and the `vput'#111 command modifier):

    $ echo 'addrcodec e Dr. Diet <to@fu.soj> Curd' | s-nail -#:/
    "Dr. Diet Curd" <to@fu.soj>

- All commands with the string "codec" in their name use different
  argument quoting, namely none at all, please read
  "Raw data arguments for codec commands"#24.
  This means that `urlcodec'#276 (and `imapcodec'#606) has
  slightly changed semantics.
  And, while here: there is a new `shcodec'#249, too.

- We gained "Command modifiers"#20: `\'#109 (avoid expansion of
  `commandalias'#144es), `vput'#111 (store result in variable),
  `ignerr'#110  (ignore an error of the following command, even
  if the new *errexit*#380 is set), `wysh'#112 (use shell-style
  arguments).

    $ echo 'vput cwd resvar;echo $resvar' | s-nail -#:/
    /home/steffen/src/nail.git

  And the usual sh(1) stuff: `return'#242, `shift'#253, `eval'#171,
  plus a `xcall'#285 stack-avoidance optimization (to be used in
  place of a `call'#133 which would be the last called command).
  And an "expr(1) like thing", yet simple, `vexpr'#281.

    $ echo 'vexpr + 1 2' | s-nail -#:/
    00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000011
    03 | 0x3 | 3
    $ echo 'vput vexpr resvar + 1 2;echo $resvar' | s-nail -#:/
    3

  We actually start walking (*?*#324, *^*#326).

    ? vput vexpr res regex 'bananarama' 'Bana(.+)' '\$1\$0'
    ? echo $?/$^ERRNAME :$res:
    1/NODATA ::
    ? vput vexpr res iregex 'bananarama' '(.+)rama' '\$1\$0'
    ? echo $?/$^ERRNAME :$res:
    0/NONE :bananabananarama:

  The command `vpospar'#282 can be used to manage the stack of
  positional parameters, i.e., much like "set --".
  It also offers the possibility to save and restore the stack to
  and from variables.  Etc.

  Btw., to contact the maintainer (make.rc variables
  VAL_CONTACT_WEB and VAL_CONTACT_MAIL):

    ? echo $contact-web; eval mail $contact-mail

- `if'#194 no longer performs automatic number conversion, we
  use the explicit -lt, -gt etc. syntax of the sh(1).
  Note: `if' will change to be almost identical to sh(1) if(1),
  so please ensure proper test bracketing, even if it is less
  convenient.

  Moreover, the default string comparison mode has changed to
  case-sensitive, just like in the shell.  This is because in the
  future this crux with trigger characters will vanish and `if'
  etc. will simply slurp in already expanded shell tokens, it will
  act like the shell in that respect.  We have modifiers, though,
  yet only "@i" for case-insensitivity, also for regex matches:

    LC_ALL=C
    i=`LC_ALL=C.utf8 s-nail -:/ -# -X '
       \define cset_test {
          \if [ "${ttycharset}" @i=% utf ]
             \echo $LC_ALL
             \xit 0
          \end
          \if [ "${#}" -gt 0 ]
             \wysh set LC_ALL=${1}
             \shift
             \eval xcall cset_test "${@}"
          \end
          \xit 1
       }
       \call cset_test C.UTF-8 POSIX.utf8 POSIX.UTF-8 \
          en_EN.utf8 en_EN.UTF-8 en_US.utf8 en_US.UTF-8
   '`
   [ $? -eq 0 ] && UTF8_LOCALE=$i

  Please note the `eval' in 'eval xcall cset_test "${@}".  This is
  a difference of S-nail/mailx and the sh(1)ell that will remain,
  as documented in "COMMANDS"#19: whereas the shell implements
  a language and performs standardized expansions on the line
  until finally the command is called, S-nail will decide the type
  of command line parsing dependent on the seen command, and will
  then perform a single expansion.  Therefore "${@}" will expand
  to multiple arguments if $# is greater 0, but it will expand to
  the empty string otherwise, which is not furtherly expanded away
  since it is meaningless like it is in the shell: therefore $#
  will be 1 (the empty string) not 0.

- Using an explicit proto:// prefix should get you the desired
  thing apart of *newfolders*#439, e.g.:

    ? File maildir:///tmp/x.mdir
    ? copy * file:///tmp/x.mbox

- New variable *record-files*#476 can be set to extend the meaning
  of *record*#475.  *record-resent*#477 was there already.

- New variable *ifs*#406 acts a bit like the sh(1)ell's $IFS for,
  e.g., the new `read'#227 command.

  There is a `readctl'#228 command which can be used to manage
  the active channel used by `read'#227.

- The `~' alias for `call'#133 is gone.

- `mimetype'#202 only allows specification of a single type per
  call, on the other hand no need to quote that.

- `mimeview'#206 must now be used explicitly to look at any
  non-text MIME part, for normal display etc. purposes we only
  support "copiousoutput"#593 MIME handlers.

- New *socks-proxy*#513 can be used to proxy all network traffic
  over a SOCKS5 proxy.  (Gaetan Bisson)

ChangeLog
^^^^^^^^^

- The manual has seen another major overhaul, all the variables
  are now documented in a single, sorted list, and many
  clarifications should have been added.  I hope it has become
  a better read.
  (Predrag Punosevac, Michael Convey, Hariskar, Rudolf Sykora,
  Respiranto, Thomas Dickey, Donald Mugnai)

- To support RFC 1524 a.k.a. .mailcap files (see below) many
  "trigger"-characters have been added for *pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE*#452,
  which may (rarely) affect existing values.
  The .mailcap support itself is not yet implemented.

- *mime-counter-evidence*#430 gained bit 4 (perform proper in-depth
  content inspection as necessary; set to 0xE for all bits).
  (Aharon Robbins)

- Maildir paths are now created recursively as necessary.
  (Justin Ellingwood)

- -M#66 and -m#67 options have been added to enforce a special
  send mode that will flag standard input / the given file with
  the specified / detected MIME 'Content-Type:'.  This can be used
  to directly send, e.g., HTML log output.
  (Viktor Szépe, Ralph Corderoy)

- Disallow symlinks on writable files.  Note this requires
  O_NOFOLLOW support for the operating-system-call open(2), but
  which has been standardized a long time ago.
  (Matthew Dillon)

- `retain'#241, `ignore'#195 etc. now differentiate in between
  From (the From: header) and From_ (the MBOX ident).

  In fact we now have a new `headerpick'#188 command which
  is a multiplexer for all retain and ignore lists used, call it
  without arguments to see the current setting(s).
  In v15 only `headerpick' and the standard-imposed wrappers
  `retain' and `ignore' will remain, all other wrappers will
  vanish.  Regular expressions can now be used if available:

    ? headerpick
      headerpick type retain blahblahblah cc date from \
        mail-followup-to message-id openpgp reply-to subject to \
        user-agent
      #headerpick type ignore currently covers no fields
      #headerpick save retain currently covers no fields
      headerpick save ignore '^Original-.*$' '^X-.*$' '^DKIM.*$'
      headerpick forward retain cc date from list-id \
        mail-followup-to openpgp reply-to subject to
      #headerpick forward ignore currently covers no fields

- `top'#268 has been rewritten completely, `Top'#267 is new.
  It uses a built-in set of retain/ignore headers, but it is
  possible to register a custom set via `headerpick'#188.
  Also, *toplines*#544 has been extended a bit and the new
  *topsqueeze*#545 variable may pimp your `top' experience.

    ? headerpick top retain add subject
    ? top
    [-- Message  1 -- 87 lines, 4791 bytes --]:
    Subject: Re: I can't dist to myself

    I wrote:
        3.22. bounce_delivered

- `features' has been dropped, `version'#280 extended.

- The *prompt*#467 handling has changed: we lost the capability to
  expand \?, \@ and \$, instead new "private" variables *?*#324,
  *account*#335, *mailbox-resolved*#419 and
  *mailbox-display*#418 have been introduced, and the prompt
  is completely shell expanded (thus twice with `wysh' or in v15),
  as if dollar-single-quote quoted.  We do support the reverse-
  solidus escaped bracket notation for embedding characters which
  should not be counted when calculating the width of the prompt.
  The `colour'#142 command has a slot for the prompt colour.
  We gained *prompt2*#468 as a second level prompt.

    ? var prompt
    wysh set \
      prompt='?\${?}!\${!}[\${account}#\${mailbox-display}]? '

- The filename "-" can be used as a receiver, e.g.,

    $ echo Hey,\ you | s-nail -:/ -Sexpandaddr -sUB -

- The -s#74 command line option, the `~s'#315 command escape
  as well as the corresponding slots of `~^'#323 will actively
  strip [\r\n] from their value (Debian #419840).

- New `read'#227 and `echoerr'#162 commands, mostly for
  *on-compose-splice*#445.
  But also `echon'#163 and `echoerrn'#164, which do not write
  a trailing newline.

- New variable *r-option-implicit*#473 may be helpful to those
  who regulary need the functionality of the -r#72 command
  line option.  (Felipe Gasper, Martin Neitzel)

- By using new "pseudo-URLs" one can automatize the use of S/MIME
  keys / (certificates / intermediate include certificates) with
  passwords.  E.g., to drive bob@exam.ple, set
  *smime-sign-cert-bob@exam.ple* to the private key / certificate
  pair as usual, the password lookup will then be performed for
  bob@exam.ple.smime-cert-key, bob@exam.ple.smime-cert-cert and
  bob@exam.ple.smime-include-certs.
  Like this the password can be stored in an encrypted .netrc file
  when *netrc-lookup*#437 and *netrc-pipe*#438 are set, or it may
  be stored in an encrypted resource file that has been loaded via
  `source'#259 as a simple *password*#450 variable.

  Note that the prompting that happens as a last resort of
  password lookup will still interfere with a possibly running
  $PAGER#574 instance, dependent on the setting of *crt*#369, of
  course.  Proper job control handling and recognizing that we are
  running $PAGER when doing that prompt is a TODO for v15.  Sorry.

- Some commands, like `set'#247, `help'#191, `list'#196,
  `mlist'#204 etc., now react upon the setting of *verbose*#551
  and(/or) *debug*#373.

- `write'#284 uses iconv(3) as appropriate.

- *mbox-rfc4155*#422 has first been dropped, and was then
  reintroduced with different semantics.  Because, it can be
  helpful if a messed up MBOX is read, in which case we henceforth
  will warn you and point you to this:

    ? define mboxfix {
      \localopts yes; \wysh set mbox-rfc4155;\
        \wysh File "${1}"; \eval copy * "${2}"
    }
    ? call mboxfix /tmp/bad.mbox /tmp/good.mbox

  P.S.  Here you see how weird the current thing still is, in v15:

    ? define mboxfix {
      localopts yes; set mbox-rfc4155; File "${1}"; copy * -- "${2}"
    }

  And also in v15 we will not apply (proper) so-called MBOXO
  quoting, but instead (simply MIME) re-encode mail messages.

- `call_if'#134 is new and, different to "? ignerr call", silent
  and not messing with the return status.

- The new *smime-ca-flags*#499 and *ssl-ca-flags*#527 can be used
  to fine-tune X509_STORE_set_flags(3) a.k.a the X509 CA
  certificate verification.

    ? set ssl-ca-flags=partial-chain
    ? wysh set smime-ca-flags="${ssl-ca-flags}"

  Also, *ssl-curves*#532 for TLSv1.3.

- Socket connections use TLS S(erver)N(ame)I(ndication) as
  appropriate (RFC 7817).

- `alternates'#127 checks arguments and supports `vput'#111.
  It by default no longer replaces but appends alternates, unless
  *posix*#465 mode is active.  There is a new `unalternates'#128
  command to remove alternates.

- A new `charsetalias'#137 command.  (Pietro Cerutti, mutt#3925)

- New commands `filetype'#175 and `unfiletype'#176: in the future
  we will no longer know any builtin filetypes, in fact we already
  simulate .gz etc. via the new mechanism as necessary:

    ? filetype \
       bz2 'bzip2 -dc' 'bzip2 -zc' \
       gpg 'gpg -d' 'gpg -e' \
       gz 'gzip -dc' 'gzip -c' \
       xz 'xz -dc' 'xz -zc' \
       zst 'zstd -dc' 'zstd -19 -zc' \
       zst.pgp 'gpg -d | zstd -dc' 'zstd -19 -zc | gpg -e'

- `~<'#294 now offers a "- [HERE-delimiter]" mode for pasting etc.
  (Ralph Corderoy)

- `exit'#172 and `quit'#226 take an optional exit status.
  (That is not fixated yet, though.)

- We have a useful -h / --help output.  (Doug McIlroy)

- *encoding* obsoleted in favour of new *mime-encoding*#431, which
  now defaults to base64.

- *allnet*#337 now works (broken since nail 10.00, 2002-09-29).
