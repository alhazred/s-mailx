Welcome to nail, a mail user agent!

Nail is derived from Berkeley Mail 8.1. Its concept is to include the
essential features a modern MUA must provide but to remain compatible
with its classic ancestor.

Currently, nail can handle the quoted-printable and base64 encodings as
well as attachments. See the "nail.1" manual page for details.

This has been built successfull on my SuSE 6.3 Linux system and nowhere
else. It should be possible also on every glibc 2.1 / egcs Linux. If
you can build it on other operating systems, please contact me and
send me a diff with your changes so I can include them in this archive.

If you detect a bug and cannot fix it yourselves, please send me the
unaltered mail message that caused the problem along with a description!
This may be a privacy issue, but it is nearly impossible to fix the
error without an exact reconstruction.

Enjoy!
