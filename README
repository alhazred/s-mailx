===============================

S-nail is a mail processing system with a command syntax reminiscent of
ed(1) with lines replaced by messages.  It is intended to provide the
functionality of the POSIX mailx(1) command and offers (mostly optional)
extensions for line editing, IDNA, MIME, S/MIME, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.
It is usable as a mail batch language.
S-nail is a derivative of Heirloom mailx, formerly known as nail.

S-nail has a git(1) repository [1] (browsable [2]) and regulary produces
release tarballs [3].  There is a project overview page [4], but more
information is available through the S-nail entry on my private webpage
[5] -- there also exists the possibility to read the manual of the
current release online [6].  S-nail now has its own mailing list [7;
listinfo: 8], which doesn't require subscription, but moderator approval
may hold your message back: please be patient, thank you.
And GMANE.org added s-nail-users@ to their archive [9] -- thank you!

See the file INSTALL for installation notes and NEWS for release update
information.  The S-nail(1) git(1) repository consists of four branches:

- master: rooted on top of *heirloom*, this adapts Heirloom mailx(1) as
  S-nail(1).  This is the stable branch that a normal user should track.
  It is updated once a release is made, and will otherwise only see
  cherry-picked bugfixes.

- next: rooted on top of *master*, this consists of a furious mixture of
  commits that eventually end up in *master*; it is a snapshot of the
  *crawl* branch, taken once that seemed to be quite stable.

- crawl: because of my brain-damaged way of working this is what *next*
  ought to be, but since people are using *next* i needed to isolate my
  grazy-grazy-grazy fixup-cross-your-fingers-now-that commits somewhere
  else.

- heirloom: a full git(1) cvsimport of the Heirloom mailx(1) cvs(1)
  repository.

To clone only the [master] branch, which is what a normal user most
likely is interested in, can be accomplished like that:

  $ mkdir s-nail.git
  $ cd s-nail.git
  $ git init
  $ git remote add origin -t master git://git.code.sf.net/p/s-nail/code
  $ git fetch -v
  $ git checkout master

AUTHORS (file content)
======================

Berkeley Mail was (according to def.h) developed by Kurt Shoens, dated
March 25, 1978. I very much regret that it seems impossible to include
the people that contributed within the around fifteen years of history
of BSD Mail. If you know more about this, contact me.

After the 4.4BSD release in 1993, Mail was not further developed
officially.  The code that Heirloom mailx is based on contains
numerous patches from OpenBSD, NetBSD, RedHat and Debian. Namely
the NetBSD developer Christos Zoulas wrote much of it.

The maintainer and primary developer of Heirloom mailx is
Gunnar Ritter. Its development started under the name "nail" in
February 2000 and added especially the MIME code, network protocol
support, and POSIX conformance improvements. In March 2006, the
program has been integrated into the Heirloom project.

In 2012 the stale Heirloom mailx(1) was adapted as S-nail(1) by
Steffen "Daode" Nurpmeso.
