===============================

S-nail(1) is a fork of Heirloom mailx(1), formerly known as nail(1).
It was forked from Heirloom mailx 12.5 on 2012-05-08, though i did not
really look at the code before 2012-09-18, once i claimed on nail-devel@
that S-nail(1) will be made available publically.

S-nail has its git(1) repository on <git.code.sf.net/p/s-nail/code>
(browse it at <http://sourceforge.net/p/s-nail/code/>) and a release
tarball to be downloaded from
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/s-nail/files/latest/download?source=files>.
You may also throw on eye on
<http://sdaoden.users.sourceforge.net/code.html#s-nail>.
The manual can be browsed online at
<http://sdaoden.users.sourceforge.net/code-nail.html>.

See the file INSTALL for installation notes and NEWS for release update
information.  Mail contact is supposed to go through the normal
nail-devel@lists.sourceforge.net list.

The S-nail(1) git(1) repository consists of three branches:

- master: rooted on top of *heirloom*, this adapts Heirloom mailx(1) as
  S-nail(1).

- next: rooted on top of *master*, this consists of a furious mixture of
  commits that eventually end up in *master*.

- heirloom: a full git(1) cvsimport of the Heirloom mailx(1) cvs(1)
  repository.

AUTHORS (file content)
======================

Berkeley Mail was (according to def.h) developed by Kurt Shoens, dated
March 25, 1978. I very much regret that it seems impossible to include
the people that contributed within the around fifteen years of history
of BSD Mail. If you know more about this, contact me.

After the 4.4BSD release in 1993, Mail was not further developed
officially.  The code that Heirloom mailx is based on contains
numerous patches from OpenBSD, NetBSD, RedHat and Debian. Namely
the NetBSD developer Christos Zoulas wrote much of it.

The maintainer and primary developer of Heirloom mailx is
Gunnar Ritter. Its development started under the name "nail" in
February 2000 and added especially the MIME code, network protocol
support, and POSIX conformance improvements. In March 2006, the
program has been integrated into the Heirloom project.

In 2012 the stale Heirloom mailx(1) was adapted as S-nail(1) by
Steffen "Daode" Nurpmeso.
