Welcome to nail, a mail user agent!

Nail is derived from Berkeley Mail 8.1. Its concept is to include the
essential features a modern MUA must provide but to remain compatible
with its classic ancestor. Especially, nail has the ability to send
and receive MIME messages.

To use nail, you must have a working sendmail setup or another program
that behaves like sendmail when it reveives mail from its standard input.
If you want to read from a POP or IMAP mailbox, you also have to set up
a program like e.g. fetchmail since nail does not contain any network
client code.

To compile nail, first look
- at the top of the Makefile
- at pathnames.h
and set the definitions according to your system's settings. The defaults
are set to match Linux 2.2 systems using glibc 2.1.

Then type `make' and optionally `make install'. As a last step, edit
the personal and system-wide run time configuration files to match
your needs. You _really_ should do this or at least install the
template in the `misc' directory of the build tree because most of
the defaults still have the compatibility values of fifteen years ago.
For batch usage, it may be more convenient to pass the configuration as
environment variables only, as e.g. `from=user@host nail -n' does.

Nail has been built successfully on the following operating systems:

Linux 		2.2 with glibc 2.1, 2.0 with libc5
FreeBSD		4.0-STABLE
Solaris		2.6
UnixWare	2.1.2

If you can build it on other operating systems, please contact me and
send me a diff with your changes so I can include them in this archive.
If there are no changes, even better, but I would like to hear from
you anyway to extend this list then.

It should generally be possible to build nail on most POSIX.1 compatible
systems without much effort.

Note that the mbox format based on the `Content-Length:' header field that
is used on most SVR4 systems by default is not supported by nail. As this
format generally is a design flaw, you should fix your system by either
using procmail for local mail delivery, which is a good idea anyway,
or at least add the -E flag to the Mlocal line in /etc/sendmail.cf if
using /usr/lib/mail.local.

If you are using gcc to compile nail and get warnings, it is usually
something serious or at least interesting, so they are worth mailing
me. If you use another compiler (especially on SysV), however, do not
assume anything; these compilers are sometimes too stupid to recognize
correct code, hopefully they can compile it at least.

If you detect a bug and cannot fix it yourselves, please send me the
unaltered mail message that caused the problem along with a description!
This may be a privacy issue, but it is nearly impossible to fix the
error without an exact reconstruction.

If nail dumps core and you work on a Linux i386 system, please send me also
- the version of the kernel and of the libc
- the nail binary that dumped core
- a strace(1) or ltrace(1) output.
Do not send me the core file unless you enabled the debugging using the
-g flag while you compiled nail.

If you work on another kind of machine, you can send me a description
and a trace output, of cause, but I cannot handle your binaries then.

If you have an idea how to improve nail, you are also invited to write
me. But you should remember that nail's primary goal is to remain
clean and simple. All ideas are worth at least a discussion, though.

Enjoy!
