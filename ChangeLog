[10.5] released 4/27/03
* A command line argument specifying a To-address can contain multiple
  recipients separated by commas (Werner Fink).
* 'showname' variable (based on code contributed by Stephen Isard).
* Display nonprintable characters in mail addresses as question marks.
* Fixed MIME encoding of user's From address with respect to quoted
  characters.
* 'autobcc' and 'autocc' variables.
* The effects of the 'bsdcompat' variable are now individually configurable.
  This introduces the 'bsdflags', 'bsdheadline', 'bsdset', 'bsdannounce',
  'askatend', 'bsdorder', and 'bsdmsgs' variables.
* The current message pointer could be garbled when 'newmail' was set and
  new messages appeared (Fix by Stephen Isard).

[10.4] released 1/19/03
* A missing #ifdef HAVE_ICONV caused build errors on platforms without
  iconv() support (J.A. Neitzel, Jens Schleusener, Lars Kellogg-Stedman,
  Felicia Neff, Chris Pinnock).
* Extraction of parts from header fields with more than 2560 characters
  fixed (Lukasz Sznuk, William Cherry).
* Source archive name in nail.spec corrected (Didar Hussain).
* Fixed segmentation violation when encountering multipart header fields
  that contain no ':' character (William Cherry).
* Respect the 'allnet' variable when comparing strings in message lists.
* IPv6 support (Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino).

[10.3] released 11/29/02
* Fixed a buffer overflow that occured with iconv() support disabled (Stan
  Tobias).
* MIME encoding of '(non-ASCII-string' comment strings in address fields
  fixed (non-ASCII-string immediately following the opening parenthesis).
* Convert header fields to outgoing character set even if the body contains
  ASCII characters only.
* Build properly on platforms without socket support (J.A. Neitzel).
* Don't require towupper() with mbtowc() (J.A. Neitzel). Searches for
  wide characters in subject fields are not case-insensitive without
  towupper().
* Some OpenBSD and NetBSD versions don't adjust the kernel file offset
  properly after a 'fflush(); rewind()' sequence, violating POSIX.1.
  This caused empty mails to be sent if the 'record' variable was set.
  The code now works around the problem (Thanks to J.A. Neitzel).
* NetBSD lacks gethostent(), causing the configure check for socket
  support to fail. gethostbyname() is now used instead (Thanks to J.A.
  Neitzel).

[10.2] released 11/23/02
* Fixed a NULL pointer dereference that occured if the 'showto' variable
  was used without the 'alternates' command (Bugreport by Bob Tennent).
* POP3 client with SSL/TLS support. See the description of the 'folder'
  command, the 'EXAMPLES' and 'NOTES' sections in the manual page, and
  the description of the new variables 'password-user@host,
  'pop3-keepalive', 'ssl-no-default-ca', 'ssl-v2-allow', 'ssl-verify',
  'ssl-ca-dir', 'ssl-ca-file', 'ssl-cert', 'ssl-cert-user@host',
  'ssl-key', 'ssl-key-user@host', 'ssl-method', 'ssl-cipher-list'
  'ssl-rand-egd', 'ssl-rand-file'. You need to execute './configure
  --with-openssl' to compile with SSL support.
* Respect assignments to the MAIL variable in startup scripts.
* Secondary mailboxes with %:folder (see the 'folder' command).
* 'shortcut' and 'unshortcut' commands.
* NAIL_EXTRA_RC variable.
* ',' address (matches the parent of the current message).
* ';' address (matches the message that was previously the current message).
* Recognize MIME in header field searches with '/'.
* The 'save' and 'copy' commands use the mbox file if invoked without
  an argument.
* Use wordexp() to expand special characters in filenames if available.
  $SHELL-specific metacharacters are thus no longer recognized.
* The output of the 'from' command is piped through the pager if it exceeds
  the screen height.
* 'datefield' variable.
* 'editheaders' variable (contributed by Stephen Isard).
* '-t' command line option.
* 'term' condition for 'if' command (contributed by Stephen Isard).
* Don't prepend a message with a blank line when saving if a blank line 
  is already present at the end of the file.
* Fixed quoting for command argument of 'pipe' (Stephen Isard).
* 'save' and 'copy' commands accept quoted file names with embedded whitespace.
* Allow '|shell-cmd' (Stephen Isard).
* 'piperaw' variable (Stephen Isard).
* If 'askcc' or 'askbcc' are set and 'bsdcompat' is not set, the user is
  asked for additional recipients before composing the message starts.
* Don't append an additional newline to filenames in recipient lists.
* Message lines starting with '>' were truncated by the 'forward' command.
* Don't rename old Resent-xxx fields when creating new ones.
* Deletion of attachments with '~@' fixed.
* Don't mark the saved copy of an unread message as read.
* Fixed use of a char variable for getc() (Arthur Korn).

[10.1] released 10/14/02
* POSIX.2 leaves the characters following 'From ' unspecified, so the
  presence of sender or date strings is no longer required to separate
  messages in a folder.
* 'inc' and 'newmail' commands, 'autoinc' and 'newmail' variables.
* Don't use iconv() if a message contains us-ascii characters only
  (Problem reported by Thomas Fieseler).
* Don't report 'Held n messages in mailfile' if n == 0.
* Don't report a 'Fatal error in process' with '!' unless bsdcompat is set.
* Missing fflush() caused empty mails with some GNU libc versions to be
  sent, unless SMTP was used (Problem reported by Thomas Fieseler).

[10.0] released 9/29/02
* Base64 decoding was calling malloc(0) which caused "Out of memory"
  errors on some platforms (Bugreport by Stan Tobias).
* Install nail.rc in the place specified with --with-rcfile (Bugreport by
  Jeffrey Neitzel)
* Code cleanup in send.c (Contribution by Stan Tobias).
* When writing attachment data, the 'w' command will no longer append to
  a file, but truncate and overwrite it.
* Extract filenames from obsolete 'Content-Type: ...; name=file' fields (Stan
  Tobias).
* Delete directory components from attachment filenames before saving (Fix by
  Stan Tobias).
* NAILRC variable (based on a suggestion by Stan Tobias).
* "bsdcompat" and "prompt" variables; prompt defaults to "? ".
* "allnet", "debug", "flipr", "outfolder", "sendwait", and "showto" variables
* "bang" variable. NOTE: Previous versions behaved as if this variable
   had been set.
* ~a and ~A tilde escapes with standard semantics.
* -F command line option, "Mail", "followup", "Followup", "Copy" and "Save"
  commands.
  NOTE: This changes the abbreviation of the "folder" command to "fold".
* "set nofoo" unsets the variable "foo". The variables "nosave" and "noheader"
  have therefore changed in their positive counterparts and are now set by
  default.
* The pg command is now the default pager unless bsdcompat is set.
* Line and character counts are printed for copy and save commands.
* MAILX_HEAD and MAILX_TAIL variables.
* LC_MESSAGES support.
* -I option prints 'Newsgroups:' field in header summary now. NOTE: The
  functionality of the old -I option, "interactive", is no longer available
  as an option. Use something like "env interactive= nail ..." instead. If
  only tilde escapes in send mode are needed, the new -~ option can be used.
* The optional name argument in combination with the -f option is now
  evaluated as a separate operand, not as an argument to -f. This enables
  usage as "nail -fin name", but "nail -f name -in" is no longer valid.
* Pipe the output of ~p through the PAGER if the text is long (Bugreport
  by Stan Tobias).
* The output format of the "set" command is changed to 'variable="value"'
  if bsdcompat is not set.
* Pipe the output of the "set" command through the PAGER if it is long.
* Headers are not printed automatically after executing a "folder" command
  if bsdcompat is not set.
* The "next" command was fixed according to the remark in the POSIX
  rationale not to skip a message e. g. after "delete".
* -B, -h and -~ command line options.
* Lines in message files can now be of arbitrary length and can contain
  NUL characters.
* -r disables tilde escapes; -r flag and address is passed to sendmail.
* followupall, followupsender, replyall, replysender, respondall, and
  respondsender commands.
* New, new, and Unread commands (are all aliases to unread command).
* unalias command implemented (had been documented since 4.4BSD).
* unignore, unretain, unsaveignore, and unsaveretain commands.
* If data from standard input contains NUL characters, no character
  conversions are performed and it is sent in base64 encoding.
* Non-binary data with long lines is sent in quoted-printable encoding.
* Fixed segmentation violation when using the "folder" command after
  an interrupt signal was catched.
* Resent-Reply-To: header field is no longer generated for conformance
  with RFC 2822.
* Fixed -u user option and %user special file name not to ignore 'user'.
* The 'Reply' command uses the 'Reply-To:' header field in favor of
  'From:'; the 'reply' command adds recipients given in the 'To:' and
  'Cc:' fields if a 'Reply-To:' field was present in the message. This
  means that 'Reply-To:' just overrides 'From:' without a special effect
  on the 'reply' and 'Reply' commands.
* When grabbing headers e. g. with the '~h' command, a comma is printed
  between names if bsdcompat is not set.
* RPM spec file (contributed by Didar Hussain).

* New editing mechanism for attachment list: ~@ tilde escape.
* The ~a tilde escape is obsoleted by ~@ and has been removed.

  if they are entirely valid (Bugreport by Russell Kroll).
* Sender addresses in message lists (as in 'delete from@host') match only
  the exact from address.
* Added ~x tilde escape (abort message composition without saving dead.letter).
* Fixed recognition of RFC 2045 parameter attributes (Bugreport by Russell
  Kroll).
* The "for" command now inserts an intact "Resent-Reply-To:" header field.
