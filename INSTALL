================================

Compilation
-----------

System specific notes can be found in the next section.
Any (optional) feature is adjustable and documented in `conf.rc'.
Adjustments may also take place, and are usually done, from the command
line, overriding those made in `conf.rc' (if any):

  $ [make &&] make install
  $ make uninstall          # Won't remove the system wide startup file!
  $ make distclean          # *Completely* cleanup working directory

With adjustments:

  $ make WANT_IMAP=0 install
  $ make WANT_NCL=0 PREFIX=/some/nasty/prefix install

There are also some predefined restricted configuration sets available,
which take precedence over anything else:

. CONFIG=MINIMAL
  little is left but some air to breathe; no internet connectivity, no
  internationalized domain names, no IMAP-searches, no regular
  expression searches, no command line editor, no documentation strings.

. CONFIG=MEDIUM
  Like MINIMAL, but with documentation strings, and the regular
  expression searches as well as the builtin command line editor will be
  included if that is possible.

. CONFIG=NETSEND
  WANT_SMTP and WANT_SSL settings are enabled, internationalized domain
  names will be supported if the necessary libraries are available,
  otherwise identical to MEDIUM.

E.g.:

  $ make CONFIG=MINIMAL DESTDIR=xtest install

would create a `s-nail' binary and install a `s-nail' manual etc.
under the prefix `/usr/local' but rooted under [./]`xtest', i.e., the
binary would be installed as `[./]xtest/usr/local/bin/s-nail'.
The following make(1) target exists, and note that you can use
a VERBOSE=1 command line option to gain more (or a different kind of)
verbosity:

. all         Create / check and update configuration, build.
. install     Create / check and update configuration, build, install.
. clean       Remove anything which can be rebuild.
. distclean   Remove anything which can be rebuild or reconfigured.
. uninstall   Uninstall (if configured).

. config      Only create or check and update the configuration.
. build       Only build (using the existing configuration).
. test        Run ./cc-test.sh in --check-only mode on the built binary.
. packager-install
              Only install using the built files of the existing
              configuration.  It is possible to overwrite DESTDIR= when
              using this target nonetheless (a following `uninstall'
              won't know about that overwritten value, however).

If some libraries are missing that you know are installed on your
system, or if other errors occur due to missing files but which you know
exist, please ensure that the environment variable `C_INCLUDE_PATH'
includes the necessary `include/' paths and the environment variable
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH' includes the necessary `lib/'rary paths.

The S-nail make system will inspect these two environment variables and
*automatically* convert them to cc(1) (c99(1)) -I and -L options (since
these environment variables are, different to the command line options,
not part of the POSIX standard).
To set these environment variables, the following can be done in
a Bourne/Korn/POSIX compatible shell:

  $ C_INCLUDE_PATH="${C_INCLUDE_PATH}:/usr/local/include"
  $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib"
  $ export C_INCLUDE_PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ make install

The S-nail make system will also automatically integrate pkgsrc(7) paths
into this mechanism.  pkgsrc(7) is used to handle building (compilation),
installation and removal of software packages on a lot of operating
systems, including all BSD systems, Linux, Solaris ...

Notes for S-nail(1) v14.6*
--------------------------

Note first that MAILSPOOL is by default `/var/mail' (see `conf.rc').
Running `make test' should succeed always and everywhere.

S-nail(1) has been or is used regulary on these systems (`uname -srm').
Also, i'm (compile) testing manually with WANT_AUTOCC=1, WANT_DEBUG=[01]
and WANT_AMALGAMATION=[01] (and WANT_GSSAPI=1), which is what is
reflected by the following statements.

. All with WANT_AMALGAMATION=1:
  - Dependent on the configuration you may see some warnings about
    unused functions.  This shouldn't happen for a any of the predefined
    CONFIG= urations, including the one that results from the default
    settings of `conf.rc'.  It may temporarily happen for other
    individual configurations as long as the codebase is in that heavy
    fluctuation state.  Reports are welcome to vanish them until v20.

. All 32-bit systems:
  - There _may_ be warnings about format strings, like, e.g.,

      auxlily.c:1610:10: warning: format '%lu' expects type 'long
      unsigned int', but argument 3 has type 'size_t'

    This is ugly, but it has been decided to keep the S-nail codebase
    ISO C89 compatible, so that there is no %z format string modifier.
    However, `nail.h' tries hard to detect the real type sizes and ends
    up in a way that should ensure that the actually expected datatype
    is of the same size in reality -- please see the definition of the
    `ZFMT' macro in `nail.h' to verify this statement is true.

    + In a very special test mailbox the character `â˜•' (U+2615 HOT
      BEVERAGE) is displayed as `[3m<98><95>' (`set PAGER='cat -vet''
      prints `M-bM-^XM-^U').  Because this is the only system i have
      seen this, and only in this single mailbox, i suspect a problem
      in the character conversion environment.  (I hope v14.7 brings
      sole usage of mbrtowc(3) instead of mbtowc(3) and per-message
      multibyte states.  Let's see if that fixes this problem.  I'll
      keep the VM around.)

    + Harmless iconv(3) warning again (as if we didn't have had to
      treat it specially already).

. UnixWare 7.1.4.
  + Note: this make(1) requires the -e option to pass values to make(1)
    subprocesses, so, if you want to overwrite DESTDIR= when doing
    `packager-install', you better say '$ make -e DESTDIR=xy ...'.
  + You'll see some harmless and ignorable warnings (the problematic
    looking warning `"openssl.c", line 88: initialization type mismatch'
    refers to a cast from non-const to const, which shouldn't matter).

I'm very interested in reports from other combinations.
(It should work practically everywhere, generally speaking.)

Program features yet to be overhauled
-------------------------------------

Since i've forked Heirloom mailx(1) (for real) as S-nail(1) on
2012-09-18 i make my way through the codebase, and i'm getting more
and more used to it as time goes by -- of course, i'm thinking object
and thus this codebase and i are antipodes.
The following modules have not yet been looked at and/or have known
design flaws or bugs:

  IMAP, (IMAP-) GSSAPI, (IMAP-) Caching

I'll hope to be able to release S-nail v20 on 2018-03-25, the 40th
anniversary of Mail, as a good one, then.  Also see `TODO'.
