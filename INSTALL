================================

Compilation
-----------

System specific notes can be found in the next section.
Any (optional) feature is adjustable and documented in `conf.rc'.
Adjustments may also take place from the command line, overriding
those made in `conf.rc' (if any).

  $ [make &&] make install
  $ make uninstall          # Won't remove the system wide startup file!
  $ make distclean          # *Completely* cleanup working directory

With adjustments:

  $ make WANT_IMAP=0 install
  $ make WANT_LINE_EDITOR=0 PREFIX=/some/nasty/prefix install

There are also some predefined restricted configuration sets available,
which take precedence over anything else:

. CONFIG=MINIMAL
  little is left but some air to breathe; no internet connectivity, no
  internationalized domain names, no command line editor, no
  documentation strings.

. CONFIG=NETSEND
  WANT_SMTP and WANT_SSL settings are enabled, internationalized domain
  names will be supported if the necessary libraries are available, the
  builtin command line editor will be used if possible, otherwise
  identical to MINIMAL.

E.g.:

  $ make CONFIG=MINIMAL DESTDIR=xtest install

would create a `s-nail' binary and install a `s-nail' manual etc.
under the prefix `/usr/local' but rooted under [./]`xtest', i.e., the
binary would be installed as `[./]xtest/usr/local/bin/s-nail'.

If some libraries are missing that you know are installed on your
system, or if other errors occur due to missing files but which you know
exist, please ensure that the environment variable `C_INCLUDE_PATH'
includes the necessary `include/' paths and the environment variable
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH' includes the necessary `lib/'rary paths.

The S-nail make system will inspect these two environment variables and
*automatically* convert them to cc(1) (c99(1)) -I and -L options (since
these environment variables are, different to the command line options,
not part of the POSIX standard).
To set these environment variables, the following can be done in
a Bourne/Korn/POSIX compatible shell:

  $ C_INCLUDE_PATH="${C_INCLUDE_PATH}:/usr/local/include"
  $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib"
  $ export C_INCLUDE_PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ make install

The S-nail make system will also automatically integrate pkgsrc(7) paths
into this mechanism.  pkgsrc(7) is used to handle building (compilation),
installation and removal of software packages on a lot of operating
systems, including all BSD systems, Linux, Solaris ...

Notes for S-nail(1) v14.*
-------------------------

S-nail(1) is known to be driven without errors by the `./cc-test.sh'
shell script, with the extended CFLAGS and WARN variables uncommented in
the Makefile, on the following operating systems:

o Mac OS X Snow Leopard (x86_64).
  gcc(1) and clang(1).

o FreeBSD 10.0 (amd64; 2013-06-23).
  clang version 3.3 (tags/RELEASE_33/final 183502) 20130610.

o NetBSD 6.99.23 (amd64).
  gcc (NetBSD nb1 20120916) 4.5.4 (forgot to look: ID as of 6.99.19).

o DragonFly BSD v3.4.1-RELEASE.
  gcc 4.7.2 [DragonFly] Release/2012-09-20.

o OpenBSD 5.4 (5.4 GENERIC#36 i386).
  gcc (GCC) 4.2.1 20070719.

o Slackware 14 3.2.29-smp (i386).
  gcc (GCC) 4.7.1.
  clang version 3.0 (tags/RELEASE_30/final).

o UnixWare 7.1.4.
  You need to pass ``CFLAGS='-v -O''' to the make(1) run.
  And `conf.rc' sets `MAILSPOOL=/var/mail' by default, whereas
  UnixWare uses `/var/spool/mail', so you need to overwrite it (either
  in `conf.rc', or from within the command line).
  Note that the `-v' compiler option still gives some harmless warnings.

OpenIndiana is targeted for v14.5.
And i'm very interested in reports from other combinations.
(It should work practically everywhere, generally speaking.)

Program features yet to be overhauled
-------------------------------------

Since i've forked Heirloom mailx(1) (for real) as S-nail(1) on
2012-09-18 i make my way through the codebase, but have not yet taken
a look (rather: at all) into the following modules/parts:

  [List view/threading], Maildir, SSL, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, GSSAPI, Caching

These will remain features of S-nail(1) and they will be looked at, and
of course i will fix bugs when i notice them, but they are not yet part
of the overhauled "S-nail core" (though SMTP and POP are in daily use,
and IMAP is slowly coming along).

I'll hope to be able to release S-nail v20 on 2018-03-25, the 40th
anniversary of Mail, as a good one, then.  Also see `TODO'.
