.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
.Bd -filled -compact -offset indent
.Sy Compatibility note:
S-nail (\*(UA) will wrap up into \%S-mailx in v15.0 (circa 2018).
Backward incompatibility has to be expected \(en
.Sx COMMANDS
will use
.Xr \&\&sh 1 Ns
-style argument quoting rules, for example.
New and old behaviour is flagged \*(IN and \*(OU, and setting
.Va v15-compat ,
one of the many
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" ,
will choose new behaviour when applicable.
\*(OB flags what will vanish, and enabling
.Fl d
or
.Fl v
enables obsoletion warnings.
.Ed
.
.Pp
\*(UA is a mail processing system with a command syntax reminiscent of
.Xr ed 1
with lines replaced by messages.
It is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX
.Xr mailx 1
command, but is MIME capable and optionally offers extensions for
line editing, S/MIME, SMTP and POP3 among others.
It is usable as a mail batch language.
.
.\" .Ss "Options" {{{
.Ss "Options"
.
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl _ Ar _ddr"
.Mx
.It Fl \&: Ar spec
Explicitly control which of the
.Sx "Resource files"
shall be loaded: if the letter
.Ql s
is (case-insensitively) part of the
.Ar spec
then the system wide
.Pa \*(UR
is loaded, likewise the letter
.Ql u
controls loading of the user's personal
.Pa \*(ur
file, whereas the letters
.Ql -
and
.Ql /
explicitly forbid loading of any resource files.
This option should be used by scripts: to avoid environmental noise they
should
.Dq detach
from any configuration files and create a script-local environment,
explicitly setting any of the desired
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
via
.Fl S .
This option overrides
.Fl n .
.
.Mx
.It Fl A Ar account
Executes an
.Ic account
command for the given user email
.Ar account
after program startup is complete.
Being a special incarnation of
.Ic define Ns d
macros for the purpose of bundling longer-lived settings, activating
such an email account also switches to the accounts
.Ev MAIL Ns
box, for example.
.
.Mx
.It Fl a Ar file
Attach the given file to the message.
The same filename conventions as described in the section
.Sx COMMANDS
apply: shell word expansion is restricted to the tilde
.Ql ~ .
Shall
.Ar file
not be accessible but contain a
.Ql =
character, then anything after the
.Ql =
is assumed to specify the input character set and anything before
.Ql =
the filename: this is the only option to specify the input character set
(and don't perform any character set conversion) for text attachments
from the command line, not using the
.Ic ~@
tilde escape command.
.
.Mx
.It Fl B
Make standard input and standard output line-buffered.
.
.Mx
.It Fl b Ar addr
Send a blind carbon copy to
.Ar addr Ns
ess.
May be used multiple times, but it is also possible to give
a comma-separated list of receivers in a single argument, proper quoting
provided, e.g.,
.Ql -b """qrec1  ,  rec2,rec3, Ex <am@ple>""" .
Also see the section
.Sx "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode" .
.
.Mx
.It Fl c Ar addr
Send carbon copies to the given receiver(s).
May be used multiple times.
.
.Mx
.It Fl d
Sets the
.Va debug
variable which enables debug messages and disables message delivery,
among others; effectively turns almost any operation into a dry-run.
.
.Mx
.It Fl E
Set the
.Va skipemptybody
variable and thus discard messages with an empty message part body.
This is useful for sending messages from scripts.
.
.Mx
.It Fl e
Just check if mail is present (in the specified or system
.Ev MAIL Ns
box): if yes, return an exit status of zero, a non-zero value otherwise.
To restrict the set of mails to consider in this evaluation a message
specification can be added with the option
.Fl L .
.
.Mx
.It Fl F
Save the message to send in a file named after the local part of the
first recipient's address (instead of in
.Va record Ns ).
.
.Mx
.It Fl f
Read in the contents of the user's
.Ev MBOX
(or the specified file) for processing;
when \*(UA is quit, it writes undeleted messages back to this file
(but be aware of the
.Va hold
option).
Some special conventions are recognized for the optional
.Ar file
argument which are documented for the
.Ic file
command below.
Note that
.Ar file
is not a argument to the flag
.Fl \&\&f ,
but is instead taken from the command line after option processing has
been completed.
In order to use a
.Ar file
that starts with a hyphen, prefix it with a (relative) path, as in
.Ql ./-hyphenbox.mbox .
.
.Mx
.It Fl H
Display a summary of the
.Ic headers
of all messages in the specified or system
.Ev MAIL Ns
box and exit.
A configurable summary view is available via the
.Fl L
option.
.
.Mx
.It Fl h
Show a short usage summary.
Because of widespread use a
.Fl Fl help
argument will have the same effect.
.
.Mx
.It Fl i
Set the
.Va ignore
variable to ignore tty interrupt signals.
.
.Mx
.It Fl L Ar spec-list
Display a summary of all
.Ic headers
of only those messages in the specified or system
.Ev MAIL Ns
box that match the given
.Ar spec-list ,
then exit.
See the section
.Sx "Specifying messages"
for the format of
.Ar spec-list .
If the
.Fl e
(\*(OB or
.Fl H )
option has been given in addition no header summary is produced,
but \*(UA will instead indicate via its exit status whether
.Ar spec-list
matched any messages
.Pf ( Ql 0 )
or not
.Pf ( Ql 1 ) ;
note that any verbose output is suppressed in this mode and must instead
be enabled explicitly (e.g., by using the option
.Fl v ) .
.
.Mx
.It Fl M Ar type
Special send mode that will flag standard input with the MIME
.Ql Content-Type:
set to the given
.Ar type
and use it as the main message body.
\*(ID Using this option will bypass processing of
.Va message-inject-head ,
.Va signature
and
.Va message-inject-tail .
Also see
.Fl q , m , t .
.
.Mx
.It Fl m Ar file
Special send mode that will MIME classify the specified
.Ar file
and use it as the main message body.
\*(ID Using this option will bypass processing of
.Va message-inject-head ,
.Va signature
and
.Va message-inject-tail .
Also see
.Fl q , M , t .
.
.Mx
.It Fl N
Unset the
.Va header
variable and thus inhibit initial display of message headers when
reading mail or editing a mail folder.
.
.Mx
.It Fl n
Standard flag that inhibits reading the system wide
.Pa \*(UR
upon startup.
The option
.Fl \&:
allows more control over the startup sequence; also see
.Sx "Resource files" .
.
.Mx
.It Fl q Ar file
Special send mode that will initialize the message body with the
contents of the specified
.Ar file ,
which may be standard input
.Ql -
only in non-interactive context.
Also see
.Fl M , m , t .
.
.Mx
.It Fl R
Any folder opened will be in read-only mode.
.
.Mx
.It Fl r Ar from-addr
If
.Ar from-addr
is a valid address then it specifies the envelope sender address to be
passed to the MTA as
.Ql -f Ar address
when a message is send.
Shall
.Ar from-addr
include a user name, then the address components will be separated and
the name part will be passed to the MTA individually via
.Ql -F Ar name .
The given
.Ar from-addr
will also be assigned to the
.Va from
variable (as via
.Ql -Sfrom=from-addr ) ,
therefore affecting possible SMTP data transfer;
note this assignment does not cause value fixation.
.Pp
If instead an empty string is passed as
.Ar from-addr
then the content of the variable
.Va from
will be evaluated and used for this purpose whenever the MTA is
contacted.
Note that \*(UA by default, without
.Fl \&\&r
that is, neither passes
.Ql -f
nor
.Ql -F
flags to the MTA by itself.
.
.Mx
.It Fl S Ar var Ns Op = Ns value
Sets the internal
.Ar var Ns
iable and, in case of a value variable, assigns
.Ar value
to it.
Even though variables (see
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" )
.Ic set
via
.Fl S
may be overwritten from within resource files,
the command line setting will be reestablished after all resource files
have been loaded.
.
.Mx
.It Fl s Ar subject
Specify the subject of the to-be-sent message.
.
.Mx
.It Fl t
The message given (on standard input) is expected to contain, separated
from the message body with an empty line, a message header with
.Ql To: ,
.Ql Cc: ,
or
.Ql Bcc:
fields giving its recipients, which will be added to those given on the
command line.
If a message subject is specified via
.Ql Subject:
then it'll be used in favour of one given on the command line.
.Pp
Also understood are
.Ql Reply-To:
(possibly overriding
.Va replyto ) ,
.Ql Sender:
(p.\ o.\&
.Va sender ) .
Note you can also specify
.Ql From: ,
possibly overriding
.Va from
and the envelope address possibly specified with the option
.Fl r !
.Pp
The following, which are normally created automatically based
upon the message context, can also be specified:
.Ql Message-ID: ,
.Ql In-Reply-To: ,
.Ql References:
and
.Ql Mail-Followup-To:
(special address massage will however still occur for the latter).
In fact custom header fields may also be used, the content of which
is passed through unchanged.
In conjunction with
.Fl ~
.Sx TILDE ESCAPES
can be embedded, too.
Also see
.Fl M , m , q .
.
.Mx
.It Fl u Ar user
Initially read the primary system mailbox of
.Ar user ,
appropriate privileges presumed; effectively identical to
.Ql -f %user .
.
.Mx
.It Fl V
Show \*(UA's version and exit.
.
.Mx
.It Fl v
Setting the
.Va verbose
variable enables display of some informational context messages.
Using it twice increases the level of verbosity.
.
.Mx
.It Fl X Ar cmd
Add the given
.Ar cmd
to the list of commands to be executed before normal operation starts.
Correlates with
.Fl #
and
.Va batch-exit-on-error ;
the only possibility to execute commands in non-interactive mode when
reading startup files is actively prohibited.
.
.Mx
.It Fl ~
Enable
.Sx TILDE ESCAPES
even if not in interactive mode.
This can be used to, e.g., automatically format the composed message
text before sending the message:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ( echo 'line    one. Word.     Word2.'; \e
    echo '~| /usr/bin/fmt -tuw66' ) |\e
  LC_ALL=C \*(uA -:/ -d~ bob@exam.ple
.Ed
.
.Mx
.It Fl #
Enables batch mode.
In batch mode the full set of commands is available, just like in
interactive mode, and diverse variable settings and internal states are
adjusted for batch necessities, e.g., it sets
.Va emptystart ,
.Pf no Va header ,
.Va quiet ,
.Va sendwait ,
as well as
.Ev MBOX
and
.Va folder
(both to
.Pa /dev/null ) ;
also no initial header listing will be printed, and processing of
.Sx "TILDE ESCAPES"
is enabled in compose mode.
The following prepares an email message in a batched dry run:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ LC_ALL=C printf 'm bob\en~s ubject\enText\en~.\enx\en' | \e
  LC_ALL=C \*(uA -:/ -d#
.Ed
.
.Mx
.It Fl \&.
This flag forces termination of option processing in order to prevent
.Dq option injection
(attacks).
It also forcefully puts \*(UA into send mode, see
.Sx "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode" .
.El
.
.Pp
In the above list of supported command line options,
.Fl d , E , i , N
and
.Fl v
are implemented by means of setting the respective option, as via
.Fl S .
.Bk -words
.Op Ar mta-option ...

arguments that are given at the end of the command line after a
.Ql --
separator will be passed through to the mail-transfer-agent (MTA) and
persist for an entire (interactive) session \(en if the setting of
.Va expandargv
allows their recognition;
MTA arguments can also be specified in the variable

\*(UA is a direct descendant of
.Bx
Mail, a successor of the Research
.Ux
mail which
.Dq was there from the start
according to
.Sx HISTORY .
The
.Bx
Mail reference manual begins with the following words:
.
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Mail provides a simple and friendly environment for sending and
receiving mail.
It divides incoming mail into its constituent messages and allows the
user to deal with them in any order.
In addition, it provides a set of
.Xr ed 1 Ns
-like commands for manipulating messages and sending mail.
Mail offers the user simple editing capabilities to ease the composition
of outgoing messages, as well as providing the ability to define and
send to names which address groups of users.
.Ed
.
.Pp
\*(UA is thus the user side of the
.Ux
mail system, whereas the system side (mail-transfer-agent, MTA) was
traditionally taken by
.Xr sendmail 8 ;
today
.Xr postfix 1
or
.Xr exim 8
are often used for this purpose instead.
If the \*(OPal SMTP is included in the
.Ic features
of \*(UA then the system side is not a mandatory precondition for mail
delivery.
.
.Pp
Because \*(UA strives for compliance with POSIX
.Xr mailx 1
it is likely that some configuration settings have to be adjusted before
using it is a smooth experience.
The default global
.Pa \*(UR
file already bends those standard imposed settings a bit towards more
user friendliness and safety, e.g., it sets the
.Va hold
and
.Va keepsave
variables in order to suppress the automatic moving of messages to
.Ev MBOX
that would otherwise occur (see
.Sx "Message states" )
and
.Va keep
to not remove empty files in order not to mangle file permissions when
files eventually get recreated (\*(UA actively manages the file mode
creation mask via
.Va umask
upon program startup).
.Va folder ,
one of the many
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES" ,
isn't set by default so file grouping (via the
.Ql +
prefix as documented for
.Ic file )
is not enabled.
The section
.Sx EXAMPLES
contains some further suggestions.
.\" }}}
.
.\" .Ss "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode" {{{
.Ss "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode"
.
To send a message to one or more people, using a local
mail-transfer-agent (MTA; the executable path can be set via
.Va sendmail )
or the \*(OPal builtin SMTP (set and see the variable
.Va smtp )
transport to actually deliver the generated mail message, \*(UA can be
invoked with arguments which are the names of people to whom the mail
will be sent, and the command line options
.Fl b
and
.Fl c
can be used to add (blind) carbon copy receivers:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ \*(uA -s ubject -a ttach.txt bill@exam.ple
# But... try it in an isolated dry-run mode first
$ LC_ALL=C \*(uA -:/ -d -vv -Ssendwait \e
   -b bcc@exam.ple -c cc@exam.ple -s "A subject" -. \e
   "(Lovely) Bob <bob@exam.ple>"  eric@exam.ple
.Ed
.
.Pp
If standard input is a terminal rather than the message to be sent,
the user is expected to type in the message contents.
In this compose mode \*(UA treats lines beginning with the character
.Ql ~
special \(en these are so-called
.Sx "TILDE ESCAPES"
which can be used to read in files, process shell commands, add and edit
attachments and more; e.g., the tilde escape
.Ql Ic ~e
will start the text editor to revise the message in it's current state,
.Ql Ic ~h
allows editing of the most important message headers and
.Ql Ic ~?
gives an overview of available tilde escapes.
Typing
.Ql control-D
.Pf ( Ql ^D )
at the beginning of an empty line leaves compose mode and causes the
message to be sent, whereas typing
.Ql control-C
.Pf ( Ql ^C )
twice will abort the current letter (saving its contents in the file
denoted by
.Ev DEAD
unless
.Pf no Va save
is set).
Messages are sent asynchronously unless the variable
.Va sendwait
is set, therefore send errors won't be reported.
.
.Pp
A number of
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
and
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
can be used to alter default behavior; e.g.,
.Ic set Ns
ting (also via
.Fl S )
.Va editalong
will automatically startup a text editor when compose mode is entered,
.Va askcc
will cause the user to be prompted actively for carbon-copy recipients
and the
.Va dot
option will allow leaving compose mode by writing a line consisting
solely of a dot
.Pf ( Ql \&. ) .
.Va on-compose-enter
and
.Va on-compose-leave
hook macros may be set to automatically adjust some settings dependent
on receiver, sender or subject contexts.
.
.Pp
Setting
.Va from
is often necessary (e.g., for
.Va smtp
transfer), and saving a copy of sent messages in a
.Va record
may be desirable \(en as for most mailbox file targets some special
syntax conventions are recognized (see the
.Ic file
command for more on that).
Defining user email
.Ic account Ns s
for the purpose of arranging a complete environment of settings that can
be switched to with a single command or command line option may be
useful (the section
.Sx EXAMPLES
contains example configurations for sending messages via some of the
well-known public mail providers and also gives a compact overview on
how to setup a secure SSL/TLS environment).
Performing some
.Fl d
or
.Va debug
sandbox dry-run tests first will prove correctness.
.
.Pp
The section
.Sx "On URL syntax and credential lookup"
will spread light on the different ways of how to specify user email
account credentials, the
.Ql USER@HOST
variable chains, and accessing protocol-specific resources,
the section
.Sx "Character sets"
goes into the details of character encoding and how to use them for
representing messages and MIME part contents by specifying them in
.Va sendcharsets ,
and reading the section
.Sx "The mime.types files"
should help to understand how the MIME-type of outgoing attachments are
classified, and what can be done for fine-tuning.
.
.Pp
Message recipients (as specified on the command line or defined in
.Ql To: ,
.Ql Cc:
or
.Ql Bcc: )
may not only be email addressees but can also be names of mailboxes and
even complete shell command pipe specifications.
If the variable
.Va expandaddr
is not set then only network addresses (see
.Xr mailaddr 7
for a description of mail addresses) and plain user names (including MTA
aliases) may be used, other types will be filtered out, giving a warning
message.
.
.\" When changing any of the following adjust any RECIPIENTADDRSPEC;
.\" grep the latter for the complete picture
.Pp
If the variable
.Va expandaddr
is set then extended recipient addresses will optionally be accepted:
Any name which starts with a vertical bar
.Ql |
character specifies a command pipe \(en the command string following the
.Ql |
is executed and the message is sent to its standard input;
Likewise, any name that starts with the character slash
.Ql /
or the character sequence dot slash
.Ql ./
is treated as a file, regardless of the remaining content.
Any other name which contains an at sign
.Ql @
character is treated as a network address;
Any other name which starts with a plus sign
.Ql +
character specifies a mailbox name;
Any other name which contains a slash
.Ql /
character but no exclamation mark
.Ql \&!
or percent sign
.Ql %
character before also specifies a mailbox name;
What remains is treated as a network address.

It is possible to create personal distribution lists via the
.Ic alias
command, so that, for instance, the user can send mail to
.Ql cohorts
and have it go to a group of people.
These aliases have nothing in common with the system wide aliases that
may be used by the MTA (mail-transfer-agent), which are subject to the
.Ql name
constraint of
.Va expandaddr
and are often tracked in a file
.Pa /etc/aliases
(and documented in
.Xr aliases 5
and
.Xr sendmail 1 ) .
Personal aliases will be expanded by \*(UA before the message is sent,
and are thus a convenient alternative to specifying each addressee by
itself:
.
.Pp
.Dl alias cohorts bill jkf mark kridle@ucbcory ~/mail/cohorts.mbox
.
.Pp
To avoid environmental noise scripts should
.Dq detach
\*(UA from any configuration files and create a script-local
environment, ideally with the command line options

In interactive mode, which is introduced in the next section, messages

box (see the command
.Ic file
for an in-depth description of the different mailbox types that exist)
is read in and a one line header of each message therein is displayed.
The visual style of this summary of
.Ic headers
can be adjusted through the variable
.Va headline
and the possible sorting criterion via
.Va autosort .
If the initially opened mailbox is empty \*(UA will instead exit
immediately (after displaying a message) unless the variable
.Va emptystart
is set.
.
.Pp
At the
.Va prompt
the command
.Ic list
will give a listing of all available commands and
.Ic help
will give a summary of some common ones.
If the \*(OPal documentation strings are available one can type
.Ql ?X
and see the actual expansion of
.Ql X
and what it's purpose is, i.e., commands can be abbreviated
(note that POSIX defines some abbreviations, so that the alphabetical
order of commands doesn't necessarily relate to the abbreviations; it is
possible to define overwrites with the
.Ic ghost
command, however).
.
.Pp
Messages are given numbers (starting at 1) which uniquely identify
messages; the current message \(en the
.Dq dot
\(en will either be the first new message, or the first unread message,
or the first message of the mailbox; the option
.Va showlast
will instead cause usage of the last message for this purpose.
The command
.Ic headers
will display a
.Va screen Ns
ful of header summaries containing the
.Dq dot ,
whereas
.Ic from
will display only the summaries of the given messages, defaulting to the
.Dq dot .
.
.Pp
Messages can be displayed on the user's terminal with the
.Ic type
command, or short:
.Ql t .
By default the current message
.Pf ( Dq dot )
is displayed, but like with many other commands it is possible to give
a fancy message specification (see
.Sx "Specifying messages" ) ,
e.g.,
.Ql t:u
will display all unread messages,
.Ql t.
will display the
.Dq dot ,
.Ql t 1 5
will type the messages 1 and 5,
.Ql t 1-5
will type the messages 1 through 5, and
.Ql t-
and
.Ql t+
will display the last and the next message, respectively.
The command
.Ic search
(a more substantial alias of the standard command
.Ic from )
will display a header summary of the given message specification list
instead of their content, e.g., the following will search for subjects:
.
.Pp
.Dl from """@Some subject to search for"""
.
.Pp
In the default setup all header fields of a message will be displayed,
but this can be changed: either by blacklisting a list of fields via
.Ic ignore ,
or by whitelisting only a given list with the
.Ic retain
command, e.g.,
.Ql Ic \:retain Ns \0date from to cc subject .
In order to display all header fields of a message regardless of
currently active ignore or retain lists, use the command
.Ic Type .
The variable
.Va crt
controls whether and when \*(UA will use the configured
.Ev PAGER
for display instead of directly writing to the user terminal
(generally speaking).
Note that historically the global
.Pa \*(UR
not only adjusts the list of displayed headers, but also sets
.Va crt .
.
.Pp
Dependent upon the configuration a line editor (see the section
.Sx "On terminal control and line editor" )
aims at making user experience with the many
.Sx COMMANDS
a bit nicer.
When reading the system
.Ev MAIL Ns
box or when
.Fl f
(or
.Ic file )
specified a mailbox explicitly prefixed with the special
.Ql %:
modifier (propagating the mailbox to a primary one) then messages which
have been read will be moved to a secondary mailbox, the user's
.Ev MBOX
file, automatically when the mailbox is left, either by changing the
active mailbox or by quitting \*(UA (also see
.Sx "Message states" )
\(en this automatic moving from a system or primary to the secondary
mailbox is not performed when the variable
.Va hold
is set.
.
.Pp
After examining a message the user can also
.Ic delete Ql d
the message,
.Ic reply Ql r
to the sender and all recipients or
.Ic Reply Ql R
exclusively to the sender(s).
Messages can also be
.Ic forward Ns
ed (shorter alias is
.Ic fwd Ns ).
Note that when replying to or forwarding a message recipient addresses
will be stripped from comments and names unless the option
.Va fullnames
is set.
Deletion causes \*(UA to forget about the message;
This is not irreversible, though, one can
.Ic undelete Ql u
the message by giving its number,
or the \*(UA session can be ended by giving the
.Ic exit Ql x
command.
.
.Pp
To end a mail processing session one may either issue
.Ic quit Ql q
to cause a full program exit, which possibly includes
automatic moving of read messages to
.Ev MBOX
as well as updating the \*(OPal line editor
.Va history-file ,
or use the command
.Ic exit Ql x
instead in order to prevent any of these actions.

.Ss "HTML mail and MIME attachments"
.
Messages which are HTML-only get more and more common and of course many
messages come bundled with a bouquet of MIME attachments.
Whereas \*(UA \*(OPally supports a simple HTML-to-text converter to deal
with HTML messages (see
.Sx "The mime.types files" ) ,
it normally can't deal with any of these itself, but instead programs
need to become registered to deal with specific MIME types or file
extensions.
These programs may either prepare plain text versions of their input
in order to enable \*(UA to display the content on the terminal,
or display the content themselves, for example in a graphical window.
.
.Pp
To install an external handler program for a specific MIME type set an
according
.Va pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE
variable; to instead define a handler for a specific file extension set
the respective
.Va pipe-EXTENSION
variable \(en these handlers take precedence.
\*(OPally \*(UA supports mail user agent configuration as defined in
RFC 1524; this mechanism, documented in the section
.Sx "The Mailcap files" ,
will be queried for display or quote handlers if none of the former two
.\" TODO v15-compat "will be" -> "is"
did; it will be the sole source for handlers of other purpose.
A last source for handlers may be the MIME type definition itself, if
the \*(UA specific type-marker extension was used when defining the type
with the command
.Ic mimetype .
(Many of the builtin MIME types do so by default.)
.
.Pp
The variable
.Va mime-counter-evidence
can be set to improve dealing with faulty MIME part declarations as are
often seen in real-life messages.
E.g., to display a HTML message inline (that is, converted to a more
fancy plain text representation than the builtin converter is capable to
produce) with either of the text-mode browsers
.Xr lynx 1
or
.Xr elinks 1 ,
teach \*(UA about MathML documents and make it display them as plain
text, and to open PDF attachments in an external PDF viewer,
asynchronously and with some other magic attached:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if $features !@ HTML-FILTER
  #set pipe-text/html='elinks -force-html -dump 1'
  set pipe-text/html='lynx -stdin -dump -force_html'
  # Display HTML as plain text instead
  #set pipe-text/html=@
endif
mimetype '@ application/mathml+xml mathml'
wysh set pipe-application/pdf='@&=@ \e
  trap "rm -f \e"${NAIL_FILENAME_TEMPORARY}\e"" EXIT;\e
  trap "trap \e"\e" INT QUIT TERM; exit 1" INT QUIT TERM;\e
  mupdf "${NAIL_FILENAME_TEMPORARY}"'
.Ed
.
.Pp
Note: special care must be taken when using such commands as mail
viruses may be distributed by this method: if messages of type
.Ql application/x-sh
or files with the extension
.Ql .sh
were blindly filtered through the shell, for example, a message sender
could easily execute arbitrary code on the system \*(UA is running on.

\*(UA offers some support to ease handling of mailing lists.
The command

promotes all given arguments to known mailing lists, and
.Ic mlsubscribe
sets their subscription attribute, creating them first as necessary.
(On the other hand
.Ic unmlsubscribe
doesn't
.Ic unmlist
automatically, but only resets the subscription attribute.)
Using the commands without arguments will show (a subset of) all
currently defined mailing lists.
The
.Va headline
format
.Ql \&%T
can be used to mark out messages with configured list addresses
in the header display.
.
.Pp
\*(OPally mailing lists may also be specified as (extended) regular
expressions, which allows matching of many addresses with a single
expression.
However, all fully qualified list addresses are matched via a fast
dictionary, whereas expressions are placed in (a) list(s) which is

The variable
.Va followup-to-honour
will ensure that a
.Ql Mail-\:Followup-\:To:
header is honoured when the message is being replied to (via
.Ic reply

and
.Va followup-to
controls whether this header is created when sending mails; it will be
created automatically for a couple of reasons, too, like when the

.Ic Lreply
is used, when
.Ic reply
is used to respond to a message with its

being honoured etc.
.
.Pp
A difference in between the handling of known and subscribed lists is
that the address of the sender is usually not part of a generated
.Ql Mail-Followup-To:
when addressing the latter, whereas it is for the former kind of lists.
Usually because there are exceptions: say, if multiple lists are
addressed and not all of them are subscribed lists.
.Pp
For convenience \*(UA will, temporarily, automatically add a list
address that is presented in the
.Ql List-To:
header of a message that is being responded to to the list of known
mailing lists.
Shall that header have existed \*(UA will instead, dependent on the
variable
.Va reply-to-honour ,
use an also set
.Ql Reply-To:

.
.\" .Ss "Character sets" {{{
.Ss "Character sets"
.
\*(OP \*(UA detects the character set of the terminal by using
mechanisms that are controlled by the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
locale setting
(the manual for
.Xr setlocale 3
should give an overview); the \*(UA internal variable
.Va ttycharset
will be set to the detected terminal character set accordingly
and will thus show up in the output of the commands
.Ic set
and
.Ic varshow .
.
.Pp
However, a user supplied
.Va ttycharset
value is not overwritten by this detection mechanism: this
.Dq feature
must be used if the detection doesn't work properly,
and it may be used to adjust the name of the locale character set.
E.g., on BSD systems one may use a locale with the character set
ISO8859-1, which is not a valid name for this character set; to be on
the safe side, one may set
.Va ttycharset
to the correct name, which is ISO-8859-1.
.
.Pp
Note that changing the value doesn't mean much beside that,
since several aspects of the real character set are implied by the
locale environment of the system,
and that stays unaffected by the content of an overwritten
.Va ttycharset
variable.
(This is mostly an issue when interactively using \*(UA, though.
It is actually possible to send mail in a completely
.Dq faked
locale environment, an option that \*(UA's test-suite uses excessively.)
.
.Pp
If no character set conversion capabilities have been compiled into
\*(UA
.Pf ( Ic features
doesn't include the term
.Ql ICONV ) ,
then
.Va ttycharset
will be the only supported character set,
it is simply assumed that it can be used to exchange 8-bit messages,
and the rest of this section does not apply;
it may however still be necessary to explicitly set it if automatic
detection fails, since in that case it defaults to the mentioned
.\" (Keep in SYNC: ./nail.1:"Character sets", ./nail.h:CHARSET_*!)
ISO-8859-1.
.
.Pp
When reading messages, their text is converted into
.Va ttycharset
as necessary in order to display them on the users terminal.
Unprintable characters and invalid byte sequences are detected
and replaced by proper substitution characters (unless the variable
.Va print-all-chars
was set once \*(UA was started).
Also see
.Va charset-unknown-8bit
to deal with another hairy aspect of message interpretation.
.
.Pp
When sending messages all their parts and attachments are classified.
Whereas no character set conversion is performed on those parts which
appear to be binary data,
the character set being used must be declared within the MIME header of
an outgoing text part if it contains characters that do not conform to
the set of characters that are allowed by the email standards.
Permissible values for character sets can be declared using the
.Va sendcharsets
variable, and
.Va charset-8bit ,
which defines a catch-all last-resort fallback character set that is
implicitly appended to the list of character-sets in
.Va sendcharsets .
.
.Pp
When replying to a message and the variable
.Va reply-in-same-charset
is set then the character set of the message being replied to is tried
first.
And it is also possible to make \*(UA work even more closely related to
the current locale setting automatically by using the variable
.Va sendcharsets-else-ttycharset ,
please see there for more information.
.
.Pp
All the specified character sets are tried in order unless the
conversion of the part or attachment succeeds.
If none of the tried (8-bit) character sets is capable to represent the
content of the part or attachment,
then the message will not be sent and its text will optionally be
.Va save Ns d
in
.Ev DEAD .
In general, if the message
.Dq Cannot convert from a to b
appears, either some characters are not appropriate for the currently
selected (terminal) character set,
or the needed conversion is not supported by the system.
In the first case, it is necessary to set an appropriate
.Ev LC_CTYPE
locale and/or the variable
.Va ttycharset .
.
.Pp
The best results are usually achieved when \*(UA is run in a UTF-8
locale on a UTF-8 capable terminal, in which case the full Unicode
spectrum of characters is available.
In this setup characters from various countries can be displayed,
while it is still possible to use more simple character sets for sending
to retain maximum compatibility with older mail clients.
.
.Pp
On the other hand the POSIX standard defines a locale-independent 7-bit
.Dq portable character set
that should be used when overall portability is an issue, the even more
restricted subset named
.Dq portable filename character set
consisting of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, period

underscore

hyphen.

within the quotes, only backslash

.It Ar ( or criterion1 criterion2 )
All messages that satisfy either

To connect more than two criteria using
.Ql or

as with

since
.Ql (or a b c)
really means

For a simple

denotes the day of the month as one or two digits,
.Ql mon
is the name of the month \(en one of

.Ss "On URL syntax and credential lookup"
.
\*(IN For accessing protocol-specific resources usage of Uniform
Resource Locators (URL, RFC 1738) has become omnipresent.
\*(UA expects and understands URLs in the following form;
parts in brackets
.Ql []
denote optional parts, optional either because there also exist other
ways to define the information in question or because support of the
part is protocol-specific (e.g.,
.Ql /path
is used by the IMAP protocol but not by POP3);
If any of
.Ql USER
and
.Ql PASSWORD
are specified they must be given in URL percent encoded form (RFC 3986;
the commands
.Ic urlencode
and
.Ic urldecode
may be helpful):
.
.Pp
.Dl PROTOCOL://[USER[:PASSWORD]@]server[:port][/path]
.
.Pp
Note that these \*(UA URLs most often don't conform to any real
standard, but instead represent a normalized variant of RFC 1738 \(en
they are not used in data exchange but only meant as a compact,
easy-to-use way of defining and representing information in
a well-known notation.
.
.Pp
Many internal variables of \*(UA exist in multiple versions, called
variable chains for the rest of this document: the plain
.Ql variable
as well as
.Ql variable-HOST
and
.Ql variable-USER@HOST .
Here
.Ql HOST
indeed means
.Ql server:port
if a
.Ql port
had been specified in the respective URL, otherwise it refers to the plain
.Ql server .
Also,
.Ql USER
isn't truly the
.Ql USER
that had been found when doing the user chain lookup as is described
below, i.e., this
.Ql USER
will never be in URL percent encoded form, whether it came from an URL
or not; i.e., values of
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
must not be URL percent encoded.
.
.Pp
For example, whether an hypothetical URL
.Ql smtp://hey%3Ayou@our.house
had been given that includes a user, or whether the URL was
.Ql smtp://our.house
and the user had been found differently, to lookup the variable chain
.Va smtp-use-starttls
\*(UA first looks for whether
.Ql smtp-\:use-\:starttls-\:hey:you@our.house
is defined, then whether
.Ql smtp-\:use-\:starttls-\:our.house
exists before finally ending up looking at the plain variable itself.
.
.Pp
\*(UA obeys the following logic scheme when dealing with the
necessary credential information of an account:
.
.Bl -bullet
.It
If no
.Ql USER
has been given in the URL the variables
.Va user-HOST
and
.Va user
are looked up; if no such variable(s) can be found then \*(UA will,
when enforced by the \*(OPal variables
.Va netrc-lookup-HOST
or
.Va netrc-lookup ,
search the users
.Pa .netrc
file for a
.Ql HOST
specific entry which provides a
.Ql login
name: this lookup will only succeed if unambiguous (one possible matching
entry for
.Ql HOST ) .
It is possible to load encrypted
.Pa .netrc
files via
.Va netrc-pipe .
.Pp
If there is still no
.Ql USER
then \*(UA will fall back to the user who is supposed to run \*(UA,
the identity of which has been fixated during \*(UA startup and is
known to be a valid user on the current host.
.
.It
Authentication: unless otherwise noted this will lookup the
.Va PROTOCOL-auth-USER@HOST , PROTOCOL-auth-HOST , PROTOCOL-auth
variable chain, falling back to a protocol-specific default should this
have no success.
.
.It
If no
.Ql PASSWORD
has been given in the URL, then if the
.Ql USER
has been found through the \*(OPal
.Va netrc-lookup
then that may have already provided the password, too.
Otherwise the variable chain
.Va password-USER@HOST , password-HOST , password
is looked up and used if existent.
.Pp
Afterwards the complete \*(OPal variable chain
.Va netrc-lookup-USER@HOST , netrc-lookup-HOST , netrc-lookup
is looked up.
If set, the
.Pa .netrc
cache is searched for a password only (multiple user accounts for
a single machine may exist as well as a fallback entry without user
but with a password).
.Pp
If at that point there is still no password available, but the
(protocols') chosen authentication type requires a password, then in
interactive mode the user will be prompted on the terminal.
.El
.
.Pp
.Sy Note:
S/MIME verification works relative to the values found in the
.Ql From:
(or
.Ql Sender: )
header field(s), which means that the values of
.Va smime-sign , smime-sign-cert , smime-sign-include-certs
and
.Va smime-sign-message-digest
will not be looked up using the
.Ql USER
and
.Ql HOST
chains from above but instead use the corresponding values from the
message that is being worked on.
In unusual cases multiple and different
.Ql USER
and
.Ql HOST
combinations may therefore be involved \(en on the other hand those
unusual cases become possible.
The usual case is as short as:

For the former one may either link against an external library
.Pf ( Xr readline 3 ;
behaviour of \*(UA may differ slightly),
or enable the builtin Mailx-Line-Editor (MLE), which should work in all
environments which comply to the ISO C standard
.St -isoC-amd1 ,
and which will support wide glyphs if possible (the necessary
functionality had been removed from ISO C, but was included in

Prevent usage of a line editor in interactive mode by setting the

.Va line-editor-disable .
.
.Pp
\*(OP If the
.Ic history
feature is available then input from line editor prompts will be saved
in a history list that can be searched in and be expanded from.
Such saving can be prevented by prefixing input with any amount of
whitespace.
Aspects of history, like allowed content, maximum size etc., can be
configured with the variables
.Va history-file ,
.Va history-gabby ,
.Va history-gabby-persist
and
.Va history-size .
.
.Pp
\*(OP Terminal control will be realized through one of the standard
.Ux
libraries, either the
.Lb libtermcap ,
or, alternatively, the
.Lb libterminfo ,
both of which will be initialized to work with the environment variable
.Ev TERM .
Terminal control will enhance or enable interactive usage aspects, e.g.,
.Sx "Coloured display" ,
and extend behaviour of the MLE, which may learn the key-sequences of
keys like the cursor and function keys, and which will automatically
enter the so-called
.Dq ca-mode
alternative screen shall the terminal support it.
The internal variable
.Va termcap
can be used to overwrite settings or to learn (correct(ed)) keycodes.
Actual interaction with the chosen library can be disabled completely by
setting the internal variable
.Va termcap-disable ,
which may be necessary for proper operation on the actual terminal;
.Va termcap
will be queried regardless, even if the \*(OPal support for the
libraries has not been enabled at configuration time.
.

\*(OP The builtin \*(UA line editor MLE supports the following
operations; the notation
.Ql ^-LETTER
stands for the combination of the
.Ql control
key plus the mentioned character, e.g.,
.Ql ^A
means
.Dq hold down control key and press the A key .
Especially without termcap support setting respective entries in
.Va termcap
will help shall the MLE misbehave.

.
\*(OP \*(UA can be configured to support a coloured display and font
attributes by emitting ANSI / ISO 6429 SGR (select graphic rendition)
escape sequences.
Usage of colours and font attributes solely depends upon the
capability of the detected terminal type that is defined by the
environment variable
.Ev TERM
and which can be fine-tuned by the user via the internal variable
.Va termcap .
.
.Pp
On top of what \*(UA knows about the terminal the boolean variable
.Va colour-pager
defines whether the actually applicable colour and font attribute
sequences should also be generated when output is going to be paged
through the external program defined by the environment variable
.Ev PAGER
(also see
.Va crt Ns
).
This is not enabled by default because different pager programs need
different command line switches or other configuration in order to
support those sequences.
\*(UA however knows about some widely used pagers and in a clean
environment it is often enough to simply set
.Va colour-pager ;
please refer to that variable for more on this topic.
.
.Pp
If the variable
.Va colour-disable
is set then any active usage of colour and font attribute sequences
is suppressed, but without affecting possibly established
.Ic colour
mappings.
.
.Pp
To define and control colours and font attributes a single multiplexer
command family exists:
.Ic colour
shows or defines colour mappings for the given colour type (e.g.,
monochrome) and
.Ic uncolour
can be used to remove mappings of a given colour type.
Since colours are only available in interactive mode, it may make
sense to conditionalize the colour setup by encapsulating it with
.Ic if :

.Sh COMMANDS
.
Each command is typed on a line by itself,
and may take arguments following the command word.
Command names may be abbreviated, in which case the first command that
matches the given prefix will be used.
The command
.Ic list
can be used to show the list of all commands, either alphabetically
sorted or in prefix search order (these don't match, also because the
POSIX standard prescribes a set of abbreviations); a more verbose
listing will be produced if either of
.Va debug
or
.Va verbose
are set.
\*(OPally the command
.Ic help
(or
.Ic \&? ) ,
when given an argument, will show a documentation string for the
command matching the expanded argument, as in
.Ql ?t ,
which should be a shorthand of
.Ql ?type .
.
.Pp
For commands which take message lists as arguments, the next message
forward that satisfies the command's requirements will be used shall no
explicit message list have been specified.
If there are no messages forward of the current message,
the search proceeds backwards,
and if there are no good messages at all,
\*(UA shows an error message and aborts the command.
\*(ID Non-message-list arguments can be quoted using the following methods:
.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
An argument can be enclosed between paired double-quotes
.Ql """argument"""
or
single-quotes
.Ql 'argument' ;
any white space, shell word expansion, or backslash characters (except
as described next) within the quotes are treated literally as part of
the argument.
A double-quote will be treated literally within single-quotes and vice
versa.
Inside such a quoted string the actually used quote character can be
used nonetheless by escaping it with a backslash
.Ql \e ,
as in
.Ql """y\e""ou""" .
.
.It
An argument that is not enclosed in quotes, as above, can usually still
contain space characters if those spaces are backslash-escaped, as in
.Ql you\e are .
.
.It
A backslash outside of the enclosing quotes is discarded
and the following character is treated literally as part of the argument.
.El
.
.
.Pp
Some commands which don't take message-list arguments can also be
prefixed with the special keyword
.Ic \&\&wysh
to choose \*(INible behaviour, and some new commands support only the
new quoting style (without that keyword) and are flagged \*(NQ.
In the future \*(UA will (mostly) use
.Xr sh 1
compatible argument parsing:
Non-message-list arguments can be quoted using the following shell-style
mechanisms: the escape character, single-quotes, double-quotes and
dollar-single-quotes; any unquoted number sign
.Ql #
starts a comment that ends argument processing.
The overall granularity of error reporting and diagnostics, also
regarding function arguments and their content, will improve.
.
.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
The literal value of any character can be preserved by preceding it
with the escape character backslash
.Ql \e .
An unquoted dollar
.Ql $
will cause variable expansion of the given name: \*(UA
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
as well as
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
(shell) variables can be accessed through this mechanism, brace
enclosing the name is supported.
.
.It
Arguments which are enclosed in
.Ql 'single-\:quotes'
retain their literal value.
A single-quote cannot occur within single-quotes.
.
.It
The literal value of all characters enclosed in
.Ql \(dqdouble-\:quotes\(dq
is retained, with the exception of dollar
.Ql $ ,
which will cause variable expansion, as above, backquote (grave accent)
.Ql ` ,
(which not yet means anything special), backslash
.Ql \e ,
which will escape any of the characters dollar
.Ql $
(to prevent variable expansion), backquote (grave accent)
.Ql ` ,
double-quote
.Ql \(dq
(to prevent ending the quote) and backslash
.Ql \e
(to prevent escaping, i.e., to embed a backslash character as-is), but
has no special meaning otherwise.
.
.It
Arguments enclosed in
.Ql $'dollar-\:single-\:quotes'
extend normal single quotes in that backslash escape sequences are
expanded as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "Ql \eNNN"
.It Ql \ea

.It Ql \eb
emits a backspace.
.It Ql \eE

.It Ql \e\e
backslash character.
.It Ql \e'
single quote.
.It Ql \e"
double quote (escaping is optional).
.It Ql \eNNN
eight-bit byte with the octal value
.Ql NNN
(one to three octal digits), optionally with an additional
.Ql 0
suffix.
A 0 byte will suppress further output for the quoted argument.
.It Ql \exHH
eight-bit byte with the hexadecimal value
.Ql HH
(one or two hexadecimal characters).
A 0 byte will suppress further output for the quoted argument.
.It Ql \eUHHHHHHHH
the Unicode / ISO-10646 character with the hexadecimal codepoint value
.Ql HHHHHHHH
(one to eight hexadecimal digits) \(em note that Unicode defines the
maximum code to be ever supported as
.Ql 0x10FFFF
(in planes of
.Ql 0xFFFF
characters each).
This escape is only supported in locales which support Unicode (see
.Sx "Character sets" ) ,
in other cases the sequence will remain unexpanded unless the given code
point is ASCII compatible.
The character NUL will suppress further output for the quoted argument.
.It Ql \euHHHH
Identical to
.Ql \eUHHHHHHHH
except it takes only one to four hexadecimal digits.
.It Ql \ecX
the
.Ql control-X
character.
This is a mechanism that allows usage of the non-printable (ASCII and
compatible) control codes 0 to 31: to be able to create a printable
representation the numeric value 64 is added to the control code of
desire, and the resulting ASCII character set code point is then
printed, e.g., BEL is
.Ql 7 + 64 = 71 = G .
Often circumflex notation is used for the visualization purpose, e.g,
.Ql ^G ,
but the reverse solid notation has been standardized:
.Ql \ecG .
The control code NUL
.Pf ( Ql \ec@ )
ends argument processing without producing further output.
.It Ql \e$NAME

.Sy Compatibility notes:
\*(ID Note these are new mechanisms which are not supported by all
commands.
Round-tripping (feeding in things shown in list modes again) are not yet
stable or possible at all.
On new-style command lines it is wise to quote semicolon
.Ql \&;
and vertical bar
.Ql |
characters in order to ensure upward compatibility: the author would
like to see things like
.Ql ? echo $'trouble\tahead' | cat >> in_the_shell.txt
and
.Ql ? top 2 5 10; type 3 22
become possible.
Before \*(UA will switch entirely to shell-style argument parsing there
will be a transition phase where using
.Ic \&\&wysh
will emit obsoletion warnings.
E.g., the following are equivalent:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mlist @any\e\e.where\e\e.example\e\e.com
wysh mlist '@any\e.where\e.example\e.com' # This is a comment
wysh mlist $'@any\e\e\ex2Ewhere\e\e.example\e\e\e56com' # A comment
wysh mlist "@any\e.where\e.example\e.com"
.Ed
.
.Pp
In any event an unquoted backslash at the end of a command line is
discarded and the next line continues the command.
\*(ID Note that line continuation is handled before the above parsing is
applied, i.e., the parsers documented above will see merged lines.
Filenames, where expected, are subsequently subjected to the following
transformations, in sequence:
.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
If the filename begins with an unquoted plus sign, and the
.Va folder
variable is defined,
the plus sign will be replaced by the value of the
.Va folder
variable followed by a slash.
If the
.Va folder
variable is unset or is set to null, the filename will be unchanged.
.
.It
Meta expansions are applied to the filename: a leading tilde
.Ql ~
character will be replaced by the expansion of
.Ev HOME ,
except when followed by a valid user name, in which case the home
directory of the given user is used instead.
Any occurrence of
.Ql $VARIABLE
(or
.Ql ${VARIABLE} )
will be replaced by the expansion of the variable, if possible; \*(UA
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
as well as
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
(shell) variables can be accessed through this mechanism, and the usual
escape mechanism has to be applied to prevent interpretation.
If the fully expanded filename results in multiple pathnames and the
command is expecting only one file, an error results.
.Pp
In interactive context, in order to allow simple value acceptance (via
.Dq ENTER ) ,
arguments will usually be displayed in a properly quoted form, e.g., a file
.Ql diet\e is \ecurd.txt
may be displayed as
.Ql 'diet\e is \ecurd.txt' .

the default mapping (if any has been established) will only be chosen as
a last resort.
The types of precondition available depend on the mappable slot, the

.Mx
.It Ic environ
\*(NQ \*(UA has a strict notion about which variables are
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
and which are managed in the program
.Sx ENVIRONMENT .
Since some of the latter are a vivid part of \*(UAs functioning,
however, they are transparently integrated into the normal handling of
internal variables via
.Ic set
and
.Ic unset .
To integrate other environment variables of choice into this
transparent handling, and also to export internal variables into the
process environment where they normally are not, a
.Ql link
needs to become established with this command, as in, e.g.,
.
.Pp
.Dl environ link PERL5LIB from TZ
.
.Pp
Afterwards changing such variables with
.Ic set
will cause automatic updates of the program environment, and therefore
be inherited by newly created child processes.
Sufficient system support provided (it was in BSD as early as 1987, and
is standardized since Y2K) removing such variables with
.Ic unset
will remove them also from the program environment, but in any way
the knowledge they ever have been
.Ql link Ns
ed will be lost.
Note this implies that
.Ic localopts
may cause loss of links.
.
.Pp
The command
.Ql unlink
will remove an existing link, but leaves the variables as such intact.
Additionally the subcommands
.Ql set
and
.Ql unset
are provided, which work exactly the same as the documented commands
.Ic set
and
.Ic unset ,
but (additionally) link the variable(s) with the program environment and
thus immediately export them to, or remove them from (if possible),
respectively, the program environment.
.
.
.Mx
.It Ic errors
\*(OP Since \*(UA uses the console as a user interface it can happen
that messages scroll by too fast to become recognized.
Optionally an error message ring queue is available which stores
duplicates of any error message and notifies the user in interactive
sessions whenever a new error has occurred.
The queue is finite: if its maximum size is reached any new message
replaces the eldest.
The command
.Ic errors
can be used to manage this message queue: if given
.Ar show
or no argument the queue will be displayed and cleared,
.Ar clear
will only clear all messages from the queue.
.
.Mx
.It Ic exit
(ex or x) Exit from \*(UA without changing the active mailbox and skip
any saving of messages in
.Ev MBOX
as well as a possibly tracked line editor history file.
.
.Mx
.It Ic features
Show the list of features that have been compiled into \*(UA.
(Outputs the contents of the variable
.Va features . )
.
.Mx
.It Ic File
(Fi) Like
.Ic file ,
but open the mailbox readonly.
.
.Mx
.It Ic file
(fi) The file command switches to a new mailbox.
Without arguments it shows status information of the current mailbox.
If an argument is given, it will write out changes (such as deletions)
the user has made and open a new mailbox.
Some special conventions are recognized for the
.Ar name
argument:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent -width ".Ar %:__lespec"
.It Ar #
(number sign) means the previous file,
.It Ar %
(percent sign) means the invoking user's system
.Ev MAIL Ns
box,
.It Ar %user
means the primary system mailbox of
.Ar user
(and never the value of
.Va folder ,
regardless of its actual setting),
.It Ar &
(ampersand) means the invoking user's
.Ev MBOX
file and
.It Ar +file
means a
.Ar file
in the
.Va folder
directory.
.It Ar %:filespec
expands to the same value as
.Ar filespec ,
but the file is handled as a primary system mailbox by, e.g., the
.Ic mbox
and
.Ic save
commands, meaning that messages that have been read in the current
session will be moved to the
.Ev MBOX
mailbox instead of simply being flagged as read.
.El
.Pp
If the name matches one of the strings defined with the command
.Ic shortcut ,
it is replaced by its long form and expanded.
If the name ends with
.Ql .gz ,
.Ql .bz2
or
.Ql .xz
it is treated as being compressed with
.Xr gzip 1 ,
.Xr bzip2 1
or
.Xr xz 1 ,
respectively, and transparently handled through an intermediate
(un)compression step (using a temporary file) with the according
facility, sufficient support provided.
Likewise, if the named file doesn't exist, but a file with one of the
mentioned compression extensions does, then the name is automatically
expanded and the compressed file is used.
.Pp
Otherwise, if the name ends with an extension for which
.Va file-hook-load-EXTENSION
and
.Va file-hook-save-EXTENSION
variables are set, then the given hooks will be used to load and save
.Dq name ,
and \*(UA will work with an intermediate temporary file.
.Pp
MBOX files (flat file-based mailboxes) are generally locked during file
operations in order to avoid inconsistencies due to concurrent
modifications.
\*(OPal Mailbox files which \*(UA treats as system
.Ev MAIL Ns
boxes or primary mailboxes will also be protected by so-called dotlock
files, the traditional way of mail spool file locking: for any file
.Ql a
a lock file
.Ql a.lock
will be created for the duration of the synchronization \(em
as necessary a privilege-separated dotlock child process will be used
to accommodate for necessary privilege adjustments in order to create
the dotlock file in the same directory
and with the same user and group identities as the file of interest.
Also see
.Va mbox-rfc4155
for fine-tuning the handling of MBOX files.
.Pp
If
.Ar name
refers to a directory with the subdirectories
.Ql tmp ,
.Ql new
and
.Ql cur ,
then it is treated as a folder in
.Dq Maildir
format; \*(ID the variable
.Va newfolders
can be used to control the format of yet non-existent folders.
A name of the form
.Pp
.Dl \*(IN protocol://[user[:password]@]host[:port][/path]
.Dl \*(OU protocol://[user@]host[:port][/path]
.Pp
is taken as an Internet mailbox specification.
The \*(OPally supported protocols are
.Ar pop3
(POP3) and
.Ar pop3s
(POP3 with SSL/TLS encrypted transport).
The
.Ar [/path]
part is valid only for IMAP; there it defaults to
.Ar INBOX .
Also see the section
.Sx "On URL syntax and credential lookup" .
.Pp
\*(OU If
.Ar user
contains special characters, in particular
.Ql /
or
.Ql % ,
they must be escaped in URL notation \(en the command

.Mx
.It Ic if
(i) Part of the nestable

conditional execution construct \(em if the given condition is true then
the encapsulated block is executed.
POSIX only supports the (case-insensitive) conditions
.Ql r Ns
eceive
and
.Ql s Ns
end, all remaining conditions are non-portable extensions; note that
falsely specified conditions cause the execution of the entire
conditional construct until the (matching) closing
.Ic endif
command to be suppressed.
The syntax of the nestable
.Ic if
conditional execution construct requires that each condition and syntax
element is surrounded by whitespace.
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Ed
.
.Pp
The (case-insensitive) condition
.Ql t Ns
erminal will evaluate to true if the standard input is a terminal, i.e.,
in interactive sessions.
Another condition can be any boolean value (see the section
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
for textual boolean representations) to mark an enwrapped block as
.Dq never execute
or
.Dq always execute .
It is possible to check
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
as well as
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
variables for existence or compare their expansion against a user given
value or another variable by using the
.Ql $
.Pf ( Dq variable next )
conditional trigger character;
a variable on the right hand side may be signalled using the same
mechanism.
The variable names may be enclosed in a pair of matching braces.
.
.Pp
The available comparison operators are
.Ql <
(less than),
.Ql <=
(less than or equal to),
.Ql ==
(equal),
.Ql !=
(not equal),
.Ql >=
(greater than or equal to),
.Ql >
(greater than),
.Ql =@
(is substring of) and
.Ql !@
(is not substring of).
The values of the left and right hand side are treated as strings and
are compared 8-bit byte-wise, ignoring case according to the rules of
the US-ASCII encoding (therefore, dependent on the active locale,
possibly producing false results for strings in the locale encoding).
Except for the substring checks the comparison will instead be performed
arithmetically if both, the user given value as well as the variable
content, can be parsed as numbers (integers).
An unset variable is treated as the empty string.
.
.Pp
When the \*(OPal regular expression support is available, the additional
test cases
.Ql =~
and
.Ql !~
can be used.
They treat the right hand side as an extended regular expression that is
matched case-insensitively and according to the active
.Ev LC_CTYPE
locale, meaning that strings in the locale encoding should be matched
correctly.
.
.Pp
Conditions can be joined via AND-OR lists (where the AND operator is
.Ql &&
and the OR operator is
.Ql || ) ,
which have equal precedence and will be evaluated with left
associativity, thus using the same syntax that is known for the
.Xr sh 1 .
It is also possible to form groups of conditions and lists by enclosing
them in pairs of brackets
.Ql [\ \&.\&.\&.\ ] ,
which may be interlocked within each other, and also be joined via
AND-OR lists.
.
.Pp
The results of individual conditions and entire groups may be modified
via unary operators: the unary operator
.Ql \&!
will reverse the result.

a mailing list.
For example it will also implicitly generate a
.Ql Mail-Followup-To:
header if that seems useful, regardless of the setting of the variable
.Va followup-to .
.
.Mx

.
.Mx
.It Ic mimetype
Without any arguments the content of the MIME type cache will displayed.
Otherwise each argument defines a complete MIME type specification of
a type that shall be added (prepended) to the cache.
In any event MIME type sources are loaded first as necessary \(en
.Va mimetypes-load-control
can be used to fine-tune which sources are actually loaded.
Refer to the section on
.Sx "The mime.types files"
for more on MIME type specifications and this topic in general.
MIME type unregistration and cache resets can be triggered with
.Ic unmimetype .
.
.Mx
.It Ic mlist
Without arguments the list of all currently defined mailing lists
(and their attributes, if any) is shown; a more verbose listing will be
produced if either of

If the \*(OPal regular expression support is available then mailing
lists may also be specified as (extended) regular expressions (see
.Xr re_format 7
for more on those).
.
.Mx
.It Ic mlsubscribe
Without arguments the list of all currently defined mailing lists which
have a subscription attribute is shown; a more verbose listing will be

.It Ic netrc
\*(OP When used without arguments or if
.Ar show
has been given the content of the
.Pa .netrc
cache is shown, loading it first as necessary.
If the argument is
.Ar load
then the cache will only be initialized and

.Ic pipe
but also pipes ignored header fields and all parts of MIME
.Ql multipart/alternative
messages.
.
.Mx
.It Ic pipe
(pi) Takes a message list and a shell command
and pipes the messages through the command.
Without an argument the current message is piped through the command

If new mail has arrived during the session,
the message
.Dq You have new mail
will be shown.
If given while editing a mailbox file with the command line flag

Same as
.Ic resend .
.
.Mx
.It Ic Redirect
Same as
.Ic Resend .
.
.Mx
.It Ic remove

type specific removal will be performed, deleting the complete mailbox.
The user is asked for confirmation in interactive mode.
.
.Mx
.It Ic rename
Takes the name of an existing folder
and the name for the new folder
and renames the first to the second one.
Both folders must be of the same type.
.
.Mx
.It Ic Reply
(R) Reply to originator.

Unless the option
.Va fullnames
is set the recipient address will be stripped from comments, names etc.
.
.Mx
.It Ic reply
(r) Take a message and group-responds to it by addressing the sender
and all recipients.
.Va followup-to ,
.Va followup-to-honour ,
.Va reply-to-honour

influence response behaviour.
The command
.Ic Lreply
offers special support for replying to mailing lists.
Unless the option
.Va fullnames
is set recipient addresses will be stripped from comments, names etc.
If
.Va flipr
is set the commands
.Ic Reply
and
.Ic reply
are exchanged.
.
.Mx
.It Ic replyall
Similar to
.Ic reply ,
but initiates a group-reply regardless of the value of
.Va flipr .
.
.Mx
.It Ic replysender
Similar to
.Ic Reply ,
but responds to the sender only regardless of the value of
.Va flipr .
.
.Mx
.It Ic Resend
Like
.Ic resend ,
but does not add any header lines.
This is not a way to hide the sender's identity,
but useful for sending a message again to the same recipients.
.
.Mx
.It Ic resend
Takes a list of messages and a user name
and sends each message to the named user.
.Ql Resent-From:
and related header fields are prepended to the new copy of the message.

(ret) Without arguments the list of retained header fields is shown,
otherwise the given list of header fields is added to the retain list:
Header fields in the retain list are shown on the terminal when
a message is displayed, all other header fields are suppressed.
To display a message in its entirety, use the commands
.Ic Type
or
.Ic Print .
Also see
.Ic discard
and
.Ic ignore ;
.Ic retain
takes precedence over the mentioned.
.
.Mx
.It Ic Save
(S) Similar to
.Ic save,
but saves the messages in a file named after the local part of the
sender of the first message instead of (in
.Va record
and) taking a filename argument.
.
.Mx
.It Ic save
(s) Takes a message list and a filename and appends each message in turn
to the end of the file.
If no filename is given, the
.Ev MBOX
file is used.
The filename in quotes, followed by the generated character count
is echoed on the user's terminal.
If editing a primary system mailbox the messages are marked for deletion.
Filename interpretation as described for the
.Ic file
command is performed.
.
.Mx
.It Ic savediscard
Same as
.Ic saveignore .
.
.Mx
.It Ic saveignore
Is to
.Ic save
what
.Ic ignore
is to
.Ic print
and
.Ic type .
Header fields thus marked are filtered out when saving a message by
.Ic save
or when automatically saving to
.Ev MBOX .
This command should only be applied to header fields that do not contain
information needed to decode the message,
as MIME content fields do.
.
.Mx
.It Ic saveretain
Is to
.Ic save
what
.Ic retain
is to
.Ic print
and
.Ic type .
Header fields thus marked are the only ones saved with a message when
saving by
.Ic save
or when automatically saving to
.Ev MBOX .
.Ic saveretain
overrides
.Ic saveignore .
The use of this command is strongly discouraged since it may strip
header fields that are needed to decode the message correctly.
.
.Mx
.It Ic search
Takes a message specification (list) and displays a header summary of
all matching messages, as via
.Ic headers .
This command is an alias of
.Ic from .
Also see
.Sx "Specifying messages" .
.
.Mx
.It Ic seen
Takes a message list and marks all messages as having been read.
.
.Mx
.It Ic set
(se) Without arguments this command shows all internal variables which
are currently known to \*(UA (they have been set).
A more verbose listing will be produced if either of
.Va debug
or
.Va verbose
are set, in which case variables may be preceded with a comment line
that gives some context of what \*(UA knows about the given variable.
.Pp
Otherwise the given variables (and arguments) are set or adjusted.
Arguments are of the form
.Ql name=value
(no space before or after
.Ql = ) ,
or plain
.Ql name
if there is no value, i.e., a boolean variable.
Quotation marks may be placed around any part of the assignment
statement to quote blanks or tabs, e.g.,
.Pp
.Dl set indentprefix='->'
.Pp
If an argument begins with
.Ql no ,
as in
.Ql set nosave ,
the effect is the same as invoking the
.Ic unset
command with the remaining part of the variable
.Pf ( Ql unset save ) .
.Pp
Any
.Ql name
that is known to map to an environment variable will automatically cause
updates in the program environment (unsetting a variable in the
environment requires corresponding system support).
Please use the command
.Ic environ
for further environmental control.
Also see
.Ic varedit ,
.Ic varshow
and the sections
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
and
.Sx ENVIRONMENT .
.
.Mx
.It Ic shell
(sh) Invokes an interactive version of the shell.
.
.Mx
.It Ic shortcut
Without arguments the list of all currently defined shortcuts is
shown.
Otherwise all given arguments (which need not be quoted except for
whitespace) are treated as pairs of shortcuts and their expansions,
creating new or changing already existing shortcuts, as necessary.
Shortcuts may be removed via the command
.Ic unshortcut .
The expansion strings should be in the syntax that has been described
for the
.Ic file
command.
.
.Mx
.It Ic show
Like
.Ic type ,
but performs neither MIME decoding nor decryption, so that the raw
message text is shown.
.
.Mx
.It Ic size
(si) Shows the size in characters of each message of the given
message-list.
.
.Mx
.It Ic sort
Shows the current sorting criterion when used without an argument.
Otherwise creates a sorted representation of the current folder,
and changes the
.Ic next
command and the addressing modes such that they refer to messages in
the sorted order.
Message numbers are the same as in regular mode.
If the
.Va header
variable is set,
a header summary in the new order is also displayed.
Automatic folder sorting can be enabled by setting the
.Va autosort
variable, as in, e.g.,
.Ql set autosort=thread .
Possible sorting criterions are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent -width "subject"
.It date
Sort the messages by their
.Ql Date:
field, that is by the time they were sent.
.It from
Sort messages by the value of their
.Ql From:
field, that is by the address of the sender.
If the
.Va showname
variable is set, the sender's real name (if any) is used.
.It size
Sort the messages by their size.
.It spam
\*(OP Sort the message by their spam score, as has been classified by
.Ic spamrate .
.It status
Sort the messages by their message status.
.It subject
Sort the messages by their subject.
.It thread
Create a threaded display.
.It to
Sort messages by the value of their
.Ql To:
field, that is by the address of the recipient.
If the
.Va showname
variable is set, the recipient's real name (if any) is used.
.El
.
.Mx
.It Ic source
(so) The source command reads commands from the given file, which is
subject to the usual filename expansions (see introductional words of
.Sx COMMANDS ) .
If the given argument ends with a vertical bar
.Ql |
then the argument will instead be interpreted as a shell command and
\*(UA will read the output generated by it.
\*(ID Note that
.Ic \&\&source
cannot be used from within macros that execute as
.Va folder-hook Ns s
or
.Ic account Ns s ,
i.e., it can only be called from macros that were
.Ic call Ns ed .
.
.Mx
.It Ic source_if
The difference to
.Ic source
(beside not supporting pipe syntax aka shell command input) is that
this command will not generate an error if the given file argument
cannot be opened successfully.
This can matter in, e.g., resource files, since loading of those is
stopped when an error is encountered.
.
.Mx
.It Ic spamclear
\*(OP Takes a list of messages and clears their
.Ql is-spam
flag.
.
.Mx
.It Ic spamforget
\*(OP Takes a list of messages and causes the
.Va spam-interface
to forget it has ever used them to train its Bayesian filter.
Unless otherwise noted the
.Ql is-spam
flag of the message is inspected to chose whether a message shall be
forgotten to be
.Dq ham
or
.Dq spam .
.
.Mx
.It Ic spamham
\*(OP Takes a list of messages and informs the Bayesian filter of the
.Va spam-interface
that they are
.Dq ham .
This also clears the
.Ql is-spam
flag of the messages in question.
.
.Mx
.It Ic spamrate
\*(OP Takes a list of messages and rates them using the configured
.Va spam-interface ,
without modifying the messages, but setting their
.Ql is-spam
flag as appropriate; because the spam rating headers are lost the rate
will be forgotten once the mailbox is left.
Refer to the manual section
.Sx "Handling spam"
for the complete picture of spam handling in \*(UA.
.
.Mx
.It Ic spamset
\*(OP Takes a list of messages and sets their
.Ql is-spam
flag.
.
.Mx
.It Ic spamspam
\*(OP Takes a list of messages and informs the Bayesian filter of the
.Va spam-interface
that they are
.Dq spam .
This also sets the
.Ql is-spam
flag of the messages in question.
.
.Mx
.It Ic thread
\*(OB The same as
.Ql sort thread
(consider using a
.Ql ghost
as necessary).
Create a threaded representation of the current folder,
i.\|e. indent messages that are replies to other messages in the header
display and change the
.Ic next
command and the addressing modes such that they refer to messages in the
threaded order.
Message numbers are the same as in unthreaded mode.
If the
.Va header
variable is set,
a header summary in threaded order is also displayed.
.
.Mx
.It Ic top
(to) Takes a message list and displays the top few lines of each.
The number of lines shown is controlled by the variable
.Va toplines .
.
.Mx
.It Ic touch
(tou) Takes a message list and marks the messages for saving in
.Ev MBOX .
\*(UA deviates from the POSIX standard with this command,
as a following
.Ic next
command will display the following message instead of the current one.
.
.Mx
.It Ic Type
(T) Like
.Ic type
but also displays out ignored header fields and all parts of MIME
.Ql multipart/alternative
messages.
.
.Mx
.It Ic type
(t) Takes a message list and types out each message on the user's
terminal, honouring
.Ic ignore
and
.Ic retain
lists.
For MIME multipart messages, all parts with a content type of
.Ql text
or
.Ql message
are shown, the other are hidden except for their headers.
Messages are decrypted and converted to the terminal character set
if necessary.
.
.Mx
.It Ic unaccount
Delete all given accounts.
An error message is shown if a given account is not defined.
The special name
.Ql *
will discard all existing accounts.
.
.Mx
.It Ic unalias

Takes a message list and marks each message as not having been answered.
.
.Mx
.It Ic uncollapse
Only applicable to threaded mode.
Takes a message list and makes the message and all replies to it visible
in header summaries again.
When a message becomes the current message,
it is automatically made visible.
Also when a message with collapsed replies is displayed,
all of these are automatically uncollapsed.
.
.Mx
.It Ic uncolour
Forget about a
.Ic colour
mapping for the given colour type (see
.Ic colour
for a list of types) and mapping; if the optional precondition argument
is used then only the exact tuple of mapping and precondition is removed.

Decode the given URL-encoded string arguments and show the results.
Note the resulting strings may not be valid in the current locale, see
.Ic urlencode .
.
.Mx
.It Ic urlencode
URL-encode the given arguments and show the results.
Because the arguments effectively are in the character set of the
current locale the results will vary accordingly unless the input solely
consists of characters in the portable character set, see
.Sx "Character sets" .
.
.Mx
.It Ic varedit
Edit the values of or create the given variable(s) in the
.Ev EDITOR .
Boolean variables cannot be edited.
.
.Mx
.It Ic varshow
This command produces the same output as the listing mode of
.Ic set ,
including
.Va verbose Ns
ity adjustments, but only for the given variables.
.
.Mx
.It Ic verify
\*(OP Takes a message list and verifies each message.
If a message is not a S/MIME signed message,
verification will fail for it.
The verification process checks if the message was signed using a valid
certificate,
if the message sender's email address matches one of those contained
within the certificate,
and if the message content has been altered.
.
.Mx
.It Ic visual
(v) Takes a message list and invokes the display editor on each message.
Modified contents are discarded unless the
.Va writebackedited
variable is set.
.
.Mx
.It Ic write
(w) For conventional messages the body without all headers is written.
The output is decrypted and converted to its native format as necessary.
If the output file exists, the text is appended.
If a message is in MIME multipart format its first part is written to
the specified file as for conventional messages,
and the user is asked for a filename to save each other part.
For convience saving of each part may be skipped by giving an empty value;
the same result can also be achieved by writing it to
.Pa /dev/null .
For the second and subsequent parts a leading
.Ql |
character causes the part to be piped to the remainder of the user input
interpreted as a shell command;
otherwise the user input is expanded as usually for folders,
e.g., tilde expansion is performed.
In non-interactive mode, only the parts of the multipart message
that have a filename given in the part header are written,
the others are discarded.
The original message is never marked for deletion in the originating
mail folder.
For attachments,
the contents of the destination file are overwritten if the file
previously existed.
No special handling of compressed files is performed.

.It Ic z
\*(UA presents message headers in windowfuls as described under the
.Ic headers
command.
This command scrolls to the next window of messages.
If an argument is given,
it specifies the window to use.
A number prefixed by
.Ql +
or
.Ql \-
indicates that the window is calculated in relation to the current position.
A number without a prefix specifies an absolute window number,
and a

the given message is attached as a MIME
.Ql message/rfc822
and the rest of this section does not apply.
.Pp
If character set conversion has been compiled into \*(UA, then this mode
gives the user the option to specify input and output character sets,
unless the file extension indicates binary content, in which case \*(UA
asks whether this step shall be skipped for the attachment in question.
If not skipped, then the charset that succeeds to represent the
attachment data will be used in the
.Ql charset=
MIME parameter of the mail message:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
If input and output character sets are specified, then the conversion is
performed on the fly.
The user will be asked repeatedly until the desired conversion succeeds.
.It
If only an output character set is specified, then the input is assumed
to be in the
.Va ttycharset
charset and will be converted to the given output charset on the fly.
The user will be asked repeatedly until the desired conversion succeeds.
.It
If no character sets are specified at all then the algorithm that is
documented in the section
.Sx "Character sets"
is applied, but directly and on the fly.
The user will be asked repeatedly until the desired conversion succeeds.
.It
Finally, if an input-, but no output character set is specified, then no
conversion is ever performed, but the
.Ql charset=
MIME parameter value will still be set to the user input.
.It
The character set selection loop can be left by typing
.Ql control-C ,
i.e., causing an interrupt.
.\" \*(OU next sentence
Note that before \*(UA version 15.0 this terminates the entire
current attachment selection, not only the character set selection.
.El
.Pp
Without character set conversion support, \*(UA will ask for the input
character set only, and it'll set the
.Ql charset=
MIME parameter value to the given input, if any;
if no user input is seen then the
.Va ttycharset
character set will be used for the parameter value instead.
Note that the file extension check isn't performed in this mode, since
no conversion will take place anyway.
.Pp
Note that in non-interactive mode, for reproduceabilities sake, there
will always be two questions for each attachment, regardless of whether
character set conversion is available and what the file extension is.
The first asks for the filename, and the second asks for the input
character set to be passed through to the corresponding MIME parameter;
no conversion will be tried if there is input to the latter question,
otherwise the usual conversion algorithm, as above, is applied.
For message attachments, the answer to the second question is completely
ignored.
.Pp
If (instead)
.Ar filename
arguments are specified for the
.Ic \&\&~@
command they are treated as a file list of
.Xr sh 1 Ns
-style quoted arguments, optionally also separated by commas, which are
expanded and then appended to the existing list of message attachments.
Message attachments can only be added via the first method.
In this mode the (text) attachments are assumed to be in
.Va ttycharset
encoding, and will be evaluated as documented in the section
.Sx "Character sets" .

.Sh "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
.
Internal \*(UA variables are controlled via the
.Ic set
and
.Ic unset
commands; prefixing a variable name with the string
.Ql no
and calling
.Ic set
has the same effect as using
.Ic unset :
.Ql unset crt
and
.Ql set nocrt
do the same thing.
Creation or editing of variables can be performed in the
.Ev EDITOR
with the command
.Ic varedit .
.Ic varshow
will give more insight on the given variable(s), and
.Ic set ,
when called without arguments, will show a listing of all variables.
Some well-known variables will also become inherited from the
program
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
implicitly, others can be explicitly imported with the command
.Ic environ
and henceforth share the said properties.
.
.Pp
Two different kind of internal variables exist.
There are boolean variables, which can only be in one of the two states
.Dq set
and
.Dq unset ,
and value variables with a(n optional) string value.
For the latter proper quoting is necessary upon assignment time, the
introduction of the section
.Sx COMMANDS
documents the supported quoting rules.

.Ed
.
.Pp
Dependent upon the actual option the string values will be interpreted
as numbers, colour names, normal text etc., but there also exists
a special kind of string value, the
.Dq boolean string ,
which must either be a decimal integer (in which case
.Ql 0
is false and
.Ql 1
and any other value is true) or any of the (case-insensitive) strings
.Ql off ,
.Ql no
and
.Ql false
for a false boolean and
.Ql on ,
.Ql yes
and
.Ql true
for a true boolean; a special kind of boolean string is the
.Dq quadoption ,
which is a boolean string that can optionally be prefixed with the
(case-insensitive) term
.Ql ask- ,
as in
.Ql ask-yes ,
which causes prompting of the user in interactive mode, with the given
boolean as the default value.

If not set then file and command pipeline targets are not allowed,
and any such address will be filtered out, giving a warning message.

for more on this.
To accept them, but only in interactive mode, or when tilde commands
were enabled explicitly by using one of the command line options
.Fl ~
or
.Fl # ,
set this to the (case-insensitive) value
.Ql restrict
(note right now this is actually like setting
.Ql restrict,-all,+name,+addr ) .
.Pp
In fact the value is interpreted as a comma-separated list of values.
If it contains
.Ql fail
then the existence of disallowed specifications is treated as a hard
send error instead of only filtering them out.
The remaining values specify whether a specific type of recipient
address specification is allowed (optionally indicated by a plus sign
.Ql +
prefix) or disallowed (prefixed with a hyphen
.Ql - ) .
The value
.Ql all
addresses all possible address specifications,
.Ql file
file targets,
.Ql pipe
command pipeline targets,
.Ql name
plain user names and (MTA) aliases (\*(OB
.Ql noalias
may be used as an alternative syntax to
.Ql -name )
and
.Ql addr
network addresses.
These kind of values are interpreted in the given order, so that
.Ql restrict,\:fail,\:+file,\:-all,\:+addr
will cause hard errors for any non-network address recipient address
unless \*(UA is in interactive mode or has been started with the
.Fl ~
or
.Fl #
command line option; in the latter case(s) any address may be used, then.
.
.Mx
.It Va expandargv
Unless this variable is set additional mail-transfer-agent (MTA)
arguments from the command line, as can be given after a
.Ql --
separator, are ignored due to safety reasons.
However, if set to the special (case-insensitive) value
.Ql fail ,
then the presence of additional MTA arguments is treated as a hard
error that causes \*(UA to exit with failure status.
A lesser strict variant is the otherwise identical
.Ql restrict ,
which does accept such arguments in interactive mode, or if tilde
commands were enabled explicitly by using one of the command line options
.Fl ~
or
.Fl # .

The default path under which mailboxes are to be saved:
file names that begin with the plus-sign

.
.
.Mx
.It Va headline-bidi
Bidirectional text requires special treatment when displaying headers,
because numbers (in dates or for file sizes etc.) will not affect the
current text direction, in effect resulting in ugly line layouts when
arabic or other right-to-left text is to be displayed.
On the other hand only a minority of terminals is capable to correctly
handle direction changes, so that user interaction is necessary for
acceptable results.
Note that extended host system support is required nonetheless, e.g.,
detection of the terminal character set is one precondition;
and this feature only works in an Unicode (i.e., UTF-8) locale.
.Pp
In general setting this variable will cause \*(UA to encapsulate text
fields that may occur when displaying
.Va headline
(and some other fields, like dynamic expansions in
.Va prompt )
with special Unicode control sequences;
it is possible to fine-tune the terminal support level by assigning
a value:
no value (or any value other than
.Ql 1 ,
.Ql 2
and
.Ql 3 )
will make \*(UA assume that the terminal is capable to properly deal
with Unicode version 6.3, in which case text is embedded in a pair of
U+2068 (FIRST STRONG ISOLATE) and U+2069 (POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE)
characters.
In addition no space on the line is reserved for these characters.
.Pp
Weaker support is chosen by using the value
.Ql 1
(Unicode 6.3, but reserve the room of two spaces for writing the control
sequences onto the line).
The values
.Ql 2
and
.Ql 3
select Unicode 1.1 support (U+200E, LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK); the latter
again reserves room for two spaces in addition.

.
.Mx
.It Va history-gabby-persist
\*(BO\*(OP \*(UA's own MLE will not save the additional
.Va history-gabby
entries in persistent storage unless this variable is set.
On the other hand it will not loose the knowledge of whether
a persistent entry was gabby or not.
Also see
.Va history-file .
.
.Mx
.It Va history-size
\*(OP If a line editor is available this value restricts the
amount of history entries that are saved into a set and valid
.Va history-file .
A value of less than 0 disables this feature;
note that loading and incorporation of
.Va history-file
upon program startup can also be suppressed by doing this.
If unset or 0, a default value will be used.
Dependent on the available line editor this will also define the
number of history entries in memory;
it is also editor-specific whether runtime updates of this value will
be honoured.
.
.Mx
.It Va hold
\*(BO This option is used to hold messages in the system
.Ev MAIL Ns
box, and it is set by default.
.
.Mx
.It Va hostname
Use this string as hostname when expanding local addresses instead of
the value obtained from
.Xr uname 3
and
.Xr getaddrinfo 3 ,
i.e., in
.Ql Message-ID:
and
.Ql From:
fields.
Note that when
.Va smtp
transport is not used then it is normally the responsibility of the MTA
to create these fields, \*(IN in conjunction with
.Va smtp
however
.Va smtp-hostname
also influences the results;
you should produce some test messages with the desired combination of
.Va \&\&hostname ,
and/or
.Va from ,
.Va sender
etc. first.
.
.Mx
.It Va idna-disable
\*(BO\*(OP Can be used to turn off the automatic conversion of domain
names according to the rules of IDNA (internationalized domain names
for applications).
Since the IDNA code assumes that domain names are specified with the

and by the
.Va quote
option for indenting messages,
in place of the normal tabulator character
.Ql ^I ,
which is the default.
Be sure to quote the value if it contains spaces or tabs.
.
.Mx
.It Va keep
\*(BO If set, an empty mailbox file is not removed.
This may improve the interoperability with other mail user agents
when using a common folder directory, and prevents malicious users
from creating fake mailboxes in a world-writable spool directory.
Note this only applies to local regular (MBOX) files, other mailbox
types will never be removed.
.
.Mx
.It Va keep-content-length
\*(BO When (editing messages and) writing
.Ev MBOX
mailbox files \*(UA can be told to keep the
.Ql Content-Length:
and
.Ql Lines:
header fields that some MUAs generate by setting this variable.
Since \*(UA does neither use nor update these non-standardized header
fields (which in itself shows one of their conceptual problems),
stripping them should increase interoperability in between MUAs that
work with with same mailbox files.
Note that, if this is not set but
.Va writebackedited ,
as below, is, a possibly performed automatic stripping of these header
fields already marks the message as being modified.
.
.Mx
.It Va keepsave
\*(BO When a message is saved it is usually discarded from the
originating folder when \*(UA is quit.
Setting this option causes all saved message to be retained.
.
.Mx
.It Va line-editor-disable
\*(BO Turn off any enhanced line editing capabilities (see
.Sx "On terminal control and line editor"
for more).
.
.Mx
.It Va markanswered
\*(BO When a message is replied to and this variable is set,
it is marked as having been answered.
This mark has no technical meaning in the mail system;
it just causes messages to be marked in the header summary,
and makes them specially addressable.
.
.Mx
.It Va mbox-rfc4155
\*(BO \*(UA generates and expects RFC 4155 compliant MBOX text
mailboxes.
(With the restriction that RFC 4155 defines seven-bit clean data
storage, but which can be overwritten by a contrary setting of
.Va encoding ) .
Messages which are fetched over the network or from within already
existing Maildir (or any non-MBOX) mailboxes may require so-called
.Ql From_
quoting (insertion of additional
.Ql >
characters to prevent line content misinterpretation) to be applied in
order to be storable in MBOX mailboxes, however, dependent on the
circumspection of the message producer.
E.g., \*(UA itself will, when newly generating messages, choose a
.Pf Content-Transfer- Va encoding
that prevents the necessity for such quoting \(en a necessary
precondition to ensure message checksums won't change.
.Pp
By default \*(UA will perform this
.Ql From_
quoting in a way that results in a MBOX file that is compatible with
the POSIX MBOX layout, which means that, in order not to exceed the
capabilities of simple applications, many more
.Ql From_
lines get quoted (thus modified) than necessary according to RFC 4155.
Set this option to instead generate MBOX files which comply to RFC 4155.
.
.Mx
.It Va memdebug
\*(BO Internal development variable.
.
.Mx
.It Va message-id-disable
\*(BO By setting this option the generation of
.Ql Message-ID:
can be completely suppressed, effectively leaving this task up to the
mail-transfer-agent (MTA) or the SMTP server.
(According to RFC 5321 your SMTP server is not required to add this
field by itself, so you should ensure that it accepts messages without a
.Ql Message-ID . )
.
.Mx
.It Va message-inject-head
A string to put at the beginning of each new message.
The escape sequences tabulator
.Ql \et
and newline
.Ql \en
are understood.

.It Va message-inject-tail
A string to put at the end of each new message.
The escape sequences tabulator
.Ql \et
and newline
.Ql \en
are understood.
.
.Mx
.It Va metoo
\*(BO Usually, when an
.Ic alias
expansion contains the sender, the sender is removed from the expansion.
Setting this option suppresses these removals.
Note that a set
.Va metoo
also causes a
.Ql -m
option to be passed to mail-transfer-agents (MTAs);
though most of the modern MTAs don't (no longer) document this flag, no
MTA is known which doesn't support it (for historical compatibility).
.
.Mx
.It Va mime-allow-text-controls
\*(BO When sending messages, each part of the message is MIME-inspected
in order to classify the
.Ql Content-Type:
and
.Ql Content-Transfer-Encoding:
(see
.Va encoding )
that is required to send this part over mail transport, i.e.,
a computation rather similar to what the
.Xr file 1
command produces when used with the
.Ql --mime
option.
.Pp
This classification however treats text files which are encoded in
UTF-16 (seen for HTML files) and similar character sets as binary
octet-streams, forcefully changing any
.Ql text/plain
or
.Ql text/html
specification to
.Ql application/octet-stream :
If that actually happens a yet unset charset MIME parameter is set to
.Ql binary ,
effectively making it impossible for the receiving MUA to automatically
interpret the contents of the part.
.Pp
If this option is set, and the data was unambiguously identified as text
data at first glance (by a
.Ql .txt
or
.Ql .html
file extension), then the original
.Ql Content-Type:
will not be overwritten.
.
.Mx
.It Va mime-alternative-favour-rich
\*(BO If this variable is set then rich MIME alternative parts (e.g.,
HTML) will be preferred in favour of included plain text versions when
displaying messages, provided that a handler exists which produces
output that can be (re)integrated into \*(UA's normal visual display.
(E.g., at the time of this writing some newsletters ship their full
content only in the rich HTML part, whereas the plain text part only
contains topic subjects.)
.
.Mx
.It Va mime-counter-evidence
Normally the
.Ql Content-Type:
field is used to decide how to handle MIME parts.
Some MUAs however don't use
.Xr mime.types 5
or a similar mechanism to correctly classify content, but simply specify
.Ql application/octet-stream ,
even for plain text attachments like
.Ql text/diff .
If this variable is set then \*(UA will try to classify such MIME
message parts on its own, if possible, for example via a possibly
existent attachment filename.
A non-empty value may also be given, in which case a number is expected,
actually a carrier of bits.
Creating the bit-carrying number is a simple addition:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
? !echo Value should be set to $((2 + 4 + 8))
Value should be set to 14
.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
If bit two is set (2) then the detected
.Dq real
content-type will be carried along with the message and be used for
deciding which
.Va pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE
is responsible for the MIME part, shall that question arise;
when displaying such a MIME part the part-info will indicate the
overridden content-type by showing a plus-sign
.Ql + .
.It
If bit three is set (4) then the counter-evidence is always produced
and a positive result will be used as the MIME type, even forcefully
overriding the parts given MIME type.
.It
If bit four is set (8) then as a last resort the actual content of
.Ql application/octet-stream
parts will be inspected, so that data which looks like plain text can be
treated as such.
.El
.
.Mx
.It Va mimetypes-load-control
This option can be used to control which of the
.Xr mime.types 5
databases are loaded by \*(UA, as furtherly described in the section
.Sx "The mime.types files" .
If the letter
.Ql u
is part of the option value, then the user's personal
.Pa ~/.mime.types
file will be loaded (if it exists); likewise the letter
.Ql s
controls loading of the system wide
.Pa /etc/mime.types ;
directives found in the user file take precedence, letter matching is
case-insensitive.
If this option is not set \*(UA will try to load both files.
Incorporation of the \*(UA-builtin MIME types cannot be suppressed,
but they will be matched last.
.Pp
More sources can be specified by using a different syntax: if the
value string contains an equals sign
.Ql =
then it is instead parsed as a comma-separated list of the described
letters plus
.Ql f=FILENAME
pairs; the given filenames will be expanded and loaded, and their
content may use the extended syntax that is described in the section
.Sx "The mime.types files" .
Directives found in such files always take precedence (are prepended to
the MIME type cache).
.
.Mx
.It Va NAIL_EXTRA_RC
The name of an optional startup file to be read last.

.It Va pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE
When a MIME message part of type
.Ql TYPE/SUBTYPE
(case-insensitive) is displayed or quoted,
its text is filtered through the value of this variable interpreted as
a shell command.
The special value
.Ql @
forces interpretation of the message part as plain text, e.g.,
.Ql set pipe-application/xml=@
will henceforth display XML
.Dq as is .
(The same could also be achieved by adding a MIME type marker with the
.Ic mimetype
command.
And \*(OPally MIME type handlers may be defined via
.Sx "The Mailcap files"
\(em corresponding flag strings are shown in parenthesis below.)
.
.Pp
The special value
.Ql @
can in fact be used to adjust usage and behaviour of a following shell
command specification by appending trigger characters to it, e.g., the
following hypothetical command specification could be used:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set pipe-X/Y='@*!++=@vim ${NAIL_FILENAME_TEMPORARY}'
.Ed
.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width ".It Ql __"
.It Ql *
Simply by using the special
.Ql @
prefix the MIME type (shell command) handler will only be invoked to
display or convert the MIME part if the message is addressed directly
and alone by itself.
Use this trigger to disable this and always invoke the handler
.Pf ( Cd x-mailx-always ) .

.Pf ( Cd x-mailx-tmpfile ) .
If this trigger is given twice then the file will be unlinked
automatically by \*(UA when the command loop is entered again at latest
.Pf ( Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink ) .
(Don't use this for asynchronous handlers.)
.
.It Ql =
Normally the MIME part content is passed to the handler via standard

otherwise.
.
.Mx

The filename, if any is set, the empty string otherwise.
.
.Mx
.It Ev NAIL_FILENAME_GENERATED
A random string.
.
.Mx
.It Ev NAIL_FILENAME_TEMPORARY
If temporary file creation has been requested through the command prefix
this variable will be set and contain the absolute pathname of the
temporary file.
.
.Mx
.It Ev NAIL_TMPDIR
The temporary directory that \*(UA uses.
Usually identical to
.Ev TMPDIR ,
but guaranteed to be set and usable by child processes;
to ensure the latter condition for
.Ev \&\&TMPDIR
also, it'll be set.
.El
.
.
.Mx
.It Va pipe-EXTENSION
This is identical to
.Va pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE
except that
.Ql EXTENSION
(normalized to lowercase using character mappings of the ASCII charset)
names a file extension, e.g.,
.Ql xhtml .
Handlers registered using this method take precedence.
.
.Mx Va pop3-auth
.It Va pop3-auth-USER@HOST , pop3-auth-HOST , pop3-auth
\*(OP\*(IN Variable chain that sets the POP3 authentication method.
The only possible value as of now is
.Ql plain ,
which is thus the default.
.
.Mx
.Mx Va pop3-bulk-load
.It Va pop3-bulk-load-USER@HOST , pop3-bulk-load-HOST , pop3-bulk-load
\*(BO\*(OP When accessing a POP3 server \*(UA loads the headers of
the messages, and only requests the message bodies on user request.
For the POP3 protocol this means that the message headers will be
downloaded twice.
If this option is set then \*(UA will download only complete messages
from the given POP3 server(s) instead.
.
.Mx Va pop3-keepalive
.It Va pop3-keepalive-USER@HOST , pop3-keepalive-HOST , pop3-keepalive
\*(OP POP3 servers close the connection after a period of inactivity;
the standard requires this to be at least 10 minutes,
but practical experience may vary.
Setting this variable to a numeric value greater than
.Ql 0
causes a
.Ql NOOP
command to be sent each value seconds if no other operation is performed.
.
.Mx Va pop3-no-apop
.It Va pop3-no-apop-USER@HOST , pop3-no-apop-HOST , pop3-no-apop
\*(BO\*(OP Unless this variable is set the
.Ql APOP
authentication method will be used when connecting to a POP3 server that
advertises support.
The advantage of
.Ql APOP
is that the password is not sent in clear text over the wire and that
only a single packet is sent for the user/password tuple.
Note that
.Va pop3-no-apop-HOST
requires \*(IN.
.
.Mx Va pop3-use-starttls
.It Va pop3-use-starttls-USER@HOST , pop3-use-starttls-HOST , pop3-use-starttls
\*(BO\*(OP Causes \*(UA to issue a
.Ql STLS
command to make an unencrypted POP3 session SSL/TLS encrypted.
This functionality is not supported by all servers,
and is not used if the session is already encrypted by the POP3S method.
Note that
.Va pop3-use-starttls-HOST
requires \*(IN.
.
.Mx
.It Va print-alternatives
\*(BO When a MIME message part of type
.Ql multipart/alternative
is displayed and it contains a subpart of type
.Ql text/plain ,
other parts are normally discarded.
Setting this variable causes all subparts to be displayed,
just as if the surrounding part was of type
.Ql multipart/mixed .
.
.Mx
.It Va prompt
The string shown when a command is accepted.
Prompting may be prevented by setting this to the null string
(or by setting
.Pf no Va prompt ) .
If a value is assigned the following \*(UA specific additional sequences
are understood:
.Ql \e& ,
which expands to
.Dq \&?
unless
.Va bsdcompat
is set, in which case it expands to
.Dq \&& ;
note that
.Ql \e&\0
is the default value of
.Va \&\&prompt .
.Ql \e? ,
which will expand to
.Dq 1
if the last command failed and to
.Dq 0
otherwise,
.Ql \e$ ,
which will expand to the name of the currently active
.Ic account ,
if any, and to the empty string otherwise, and
.Ql \e@ ,
which will expand to the name of the currently active mailbox.
(Note that the prompt buffer is size-limited, excess is cut off.)
.Pp
Even though
.Va \&\&prompt
checks for
.Va headline-bidi
to encapsulate the expansions of the
.Ql \e$
and
.Ql \e@
escape sequences as necessary to correctly display bidirectional text,
this is not true for the final string that makes up
.Va \&\&prompt
as such, i.e., real BIDI handling is not supported.
.
.Mx
.It Va quiet
\*(BO Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.
.
.Mx
.It Va quote
If set, \*(UA starts a replying message with the original message
prefixed by the value of the variable
.Va indentprefix .
Normally, a heading consisting of
.Dq Fromheaderfield wrote:
is put before the quotation.
If the string
.Ql noheading
is assigned to the
.Va \&\&quote
variable, this heading is omitted.
If the string
.Ql headers
is assigned, the headers selected by the
.Ic ignore Ns / Ns Ic retain
commands are put above the message body,
thus
.Va \&\&quote
acts like an automatic
.Pf ` Ic ~m Ns '
.Sx "TILDE ESCAPES"
command, then.
If the string
.Ql allheaders
is assigned, all headers are put above the message body and all MIME
parts are included, making
.Va \&\&quote
act like an automatic
.Pf ` Ic ~M Ns '
command; also see
.Va quote-as-attachment .
.
.Mx
.It Va quote-as-attachment
\*(BO Add the original message in its entirety as a
.Ql message/rfc822
MIME attachment when replying to a message.
Note this works regardless of the setting of
.Va quote .
.
.Mx
.It Va quote-fold
\*(OP Can be set in addition to
.Va indentprefix .
Setting this turns on a more fancy quotation algorithm in that leading
quotation characters are compressed and overlong lines are folded.
.Va \&\&quote-fold
can be set to either one or two (space separated) numeric values,
which are interpreted as the maximum (goal) and the minimum line length,
respectively, in a spirit rather equal to the
.Xr fmt 1
program, but line-, not paragraph-based.
If not set explicitly the minimum will reflect the goal algorithmically.
The goal can't be smaller than the length of
.Va indentprefix
plus some additional pad.
Necessary adjustments take place silently.
.
.Mx
.It Va recipients-in-cc
\*(BO On group replies, specify only the sender of the original mail in
.Ql To:
and mention the other recipients in the secondary
.Ql Cc: .
By default all recipients of the original mail will be addressed via
.Ql To: .
.
.Mx
.It Va record
If defined, gives the pathname of the folder used to record all outgoing
mail.
If not defined, then outgoing mail is not saved.
When saving to this folder fails the message is not sent,
but instead saved to
.Ev DEAD .
.
.Mx
.It Va record-resent
\*(BO If both this variable and the

.
.Mx
.It Va reply-in-same-charset
\*(BO If this variable is set \*(UA first tries to use the same
character set of the original message for replies.
If this fails, the mechanism described in

is evaluated as usual.
.
.Mx
.It Va reply_strings
Can be set to a comma-separated list of (case-insensitive according to
ASCII rules) strings which shall be recognized in addition to the
builtin strings as
.Ql Subject:
reply message indicators \(en builtin are
.Ql Re: ,
which is mandated by RFC 5322, as well as the german
.Ql Aw: .
.
.Mx
.It Va replyto
A list of addresses to put into the
.Ql Reply-To:
field of the message header.
Members of this list are handled as if they were in the
.Ic alternates
list.
.
.Mx
.It Va reply-to-honour
Controls whether a
.Ql Reply-To:
header is honoured when replying to a message via
.Ic reply
or
.Ic Lreply .
This is a quadoption; if set without a value it defaults to
.Dq yes .
.
.Mx
.It Va rfc822-body-from_
\*(BO This variable can be used to force displaying a so-called
.Ql From_
line for messages that are embedded into an envelope mail via the
.Ql message/rfc822
MIME mechanism, for more visual convenience.
.
.Mx
.It Va save
\*(BO Enable saving of (partial) messages in
.Ev DEAD
upon interrupt or delivery error.
.
.Mx
.It Va screen
When \*(UA initially displays the message headers it determines the
number to display by looking at the speed of the terminal.
The faster the terminal, the more will be shown.
This option specifies the number to use and overrides the calculation.
This number is also used for scrolling with the
.Ic z
command.
Overall screen dimensions and pager usage is influenced by the
environment variables
.Ev COLUMNS
and
.Ev LINES
and the variable
.Va crt .
.
.Mx
.It Va searchheaders
\*(BO Expand message-list specifiers in the form
.Ql /x:y
to all messages containing the substring
.Dq y
in the header field
.Ql x .
The string search is case insensitive.
.
.Mx
.It Va sendcharsets
\*(OP A comma-separated list of character set names that can be used in
outgoing internet mail.
The value of the variable
.Va charset-8bit
is automatically appended to this list of character-sets.
If no character set conversion capabilities are compiled into \*(UA then
the only supported charset is
.Va ttycharset .
Also see
.Va sendcharsets-else-ttycharset
and refer to the section
.Sx "Character sets"
for the complete picture of character set conversion in \*(UA.
.
.Mx
.It Va sendcharsets-else-ttycharset
\*(BO\*(OP If this variable is set, but
.Va sendcharsets
is not, then \*(UA acts as if
.Va sendcharsets
had been set to the value of the variable
.Va ttycharset .
In effect this combination passes through the message data in the
character set of the current locale (given that
.Va ttycharset
hasn't been set manually), i.e., without converting it to the
.Va charset-8bit
fallback character set.
Thus, mail message text will be in ISO-8859-1 encoding when send from
within a ISO-8859-1 locale, and in UTF-8 encoding when send from within
an UTF-8 locale.
If no character set conversion capabilities are available in \*(UA then
the only supported character set is
.Va ttycharset .
.
.Mx
.It Va sender
An address that is put into the
.Ql Sender:
field of outgoing messages, quoting RFC 5322: the mailbox of the agent
responsible for the actual transmission of the message.
This field should normally not be used unless the
.Ql From:
field contains more than one address, on which case it is required.
The
.Va \&\&sender
address is handled as if it were in the
.Ic alternates
list.
.
.Mx
.It Va sendmail
To use an alternate mail transport agent (MTA),
set this option to the full pathname of the program to use.
It may be necessary to set
.Va sendmail-progname
in addition.
.Pp
The MTA will be passed command line arguments from several possible
sources: from the variable
.Va sendmail-arguments
if set, from the command line if given and the variable
.Va expandargv
allows their use.
Argument processing of the MTA will be terminated with a
.Ql --
separator.
.Pp
The otherwise occurring implicit usage of the following MTA command line
arguments can be disabled by setting the boolean option
.Va sendmail-no-default-arguments
(which will also disable passing
.Ql --
to the MTA):
.Ql -i
(for not treating a line with only a dot
.Ql \&.
character as the end of input),
.Ql -m
(shall the option
.Va metoo
be set) and
.Ql -v
(if the
.Va verbose
option is set); in conjunction with the
.Fl r
command line option \*(UA will also pass
.Ql -f
as well as
.Ql -F .
.
.Mx
.It Va sendmail-arguments
Arguments to pass through to the Mail-Transfer-Agent can be given via
this option.
The content of this variable will be split up in a vector of arguments
which will be joined onto other possible MTA options:
.Pp
.Dl set sendmail-arguments='-t -X \&"/tmp/my log\&"'
.
.Mx
.It Va sendmail-no-default-arguments
\*(BO Unless this option is set \*(UA will pass some well known
standard command line options to the defined
.Va sendmail
program, see there for more.
.
.Mx
.It Va sendmail-progname
Many systems use a so-called
.Xr mailwrapper 8
environment to ensure compatibility with
.Xr sendmail 1 .
This works by inspecting the name that was used to invoke the mail
delivery system.
If this variable is set then the mailwrapper (the program that is
actually executed when calling
.Dq sendmail )
will treat its contents as that name.
The default is
.Ql sendmail .
.
.Mx
.It Va sendwait
\*(BO When sending a message wait until the MTA (including the builtin
SMTP one) exits before accepting further commands.
.Sy Only
with this variable set errors reported by the MTA will be recognizable!
If the MTA returns a non-zero exit status,
the exit status of \*(UA will also be non-zero.
.
.Mx
.It Va showlast
\*(BO Setting this option causes \*(UA to start at the last message
instead of the first one when opening a mail folder.
.
.Mx
.It Va showname
\*(BO Causes \*(UA to use the sender's real name instead of the plain
address in the header field summary and in message specifications.
.
.Mx
.It Va showto
\*(BO Causes the recipient of the message to be shown in the header
summary if the message was sent by the user.
.
.Mx

.
.Mx
.It Va sign
A string for use with the

.
.Mx
.It Va signature
Must correspond to the name of a readable file if set.
The file's content is then appended to each singlepart message
and to the first part of each multipart message.
Be warned that there is no possibility to edit the signature for an
individual message.
.
.Mx
.It Va skipemptybody
\*(BO If an outgoing message does not contain any text in its first or
only message part, do not send it but discard it silently (see also the

\*(OP Specifies a file with CA certificates in PEM format for
verification of S/MIME signed messages.
.
.Mx Va smime-cipher
.It Va smime-cipher-USER@HOST , smime-cipher
\*(OP Specifies the cipher to use when generating S/MIME encrypted
messages (for the specified account).
RFC 5751 mandates a default of

(AES-128 CBC).
Possible values are (case-insensitive and) in decreasing cipher strength:
.Ql aes256
(AES-256 CBC),
.Ql aes192
(AES-192 CBC),
.Ql aes128
(AES-128 CBC),
.Ql des3
(DES EDE3 CBC, 168 bits; default if

.Pp
The actually available cipher algorithms depend on the cryptographic
library that \*(UA uses.
\*(OP Support for more cipher algorithms may be available through
dynamic loading via, e.g.,
.Xr EVP_get_cipherbyname 3
(OpenSSL) if \*(UA has been compiled to support this.

.It Va smime-crl-dir
\*(OP Specifies a directory that contains files with CRLs in PEM format
to use when verifying S/MIME messages.
.
.Mx
.It Va smime-crl-file
\*(OP Specifies a file that contains a CRL in PEM format to use when
verifying S/MIME messages.
.
.Mx
.It Va smime-encrypt-USER@HOST
\*(OP If this variable is set, messages send to the given receiver are
encrypted before sending.
The value of the variable must be set to the name of a file that
contains a certificate in PEM format.
.Pp
If a message is sent to multiple recipients,
each of them for whom a corresponding variable is set will receive an
individually encrypted message;
other recipients will continue to receive the message in plain text
unless the
.Va smime-force-encryption
variable is set.
It is recommended to sign encrypted messages, i.e., to also set the
.Va smime-sign

\*(BO\*(OP Causes \*(UA to refuse sending unencrypted messages.
.
.Mx
.It Va smime-no-default-ca
\*(BO\*(OP Don't load default CA locations when verifying S/MIME signed
messages.
.
.Mx
.It Va smime-sign
\*(BO\*(OP S/MIME sign outgoing messages with the user's private key
and include the user's certificate as a MIME attachment.
Signing a message enables a recipient to verify that the sender used
a valid certificate,
that the email addresses in the certificate match those in the message
header and that the message content has not been altered.
It does not change the message text,
and people will be able to read the message as usual.

.
.Mx Va smime-sign-cert
.It Va smime-sign-cert-USER@HOST , smime-sign-cert
\*(OP Points to a file in PEM format.
For the purpose of signing and decryption this file needs to contain the
user's private key as well as his certificate.
.Pp
For message signing
.Ql USER@HOST
is always derived from the value of
.Va from
(or, if that contains multiple addresses,
.Va sender ) .
For the purpose of encryption the recipient's public encryption key
(certificate) is expected; the command
.Ic certsave
can be used to save certificates of signed messages (the section
.Sx "Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME"
gives some details).
This mode of operation is usually driven by the specialized form.
.Pp
When decrypting messages the account is derived from the recipient
fields
.Pf ( Ql To:
and
.Ql Cc: )
of the message, which are searched for addresses for which such
a variable is set.
\*(UA always uses the first address that matches,
so if the same message is sent to more than one of the user's addresses
using different encryption keys, decryption might fail.
.
.Mx Va smime-sign-include-certs
.It Va smime-sign-include-certs-USER@HOST , smime-sign-include-certs
\*(OP If used, this is supposed to a consist of a comma-separated list
of files, each of which containing a single certificate in PEM format to
be included in the S/MIME message in addition to the
.Va smime-sign-cert

This is most useful for long certificate chains if it is desired to aid
the receiving party's verification process.
Note that top level certificates may also be included in the chain but
don't play a role for verification.
Also see
.Va smime-sign-cert .

.Mx
.It Va smtp
\*(OP Normally \*(UA invokes the program defined via
.Va sendmail
to transfer messages, as described in
.Sx "On sending mail, and non-interactive mode" .
Setting the
.Va \&\&smtp
variable will instead cause SMTP network connections be made to the
server specified therein in order to directly submit the message.
\*(UA knows about three different
.Dq SMTP protocols :
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The plain SMTP protocol (RFC 5321) that normally lives on the
server port 25 and requires setting the
.Va smtp-use-starttls
variable to enter a SSL/TLS encrypted session state.
Assign a value like \*(IN
.Ql [smtp://][user[:password]@]server[:port]
(\*(OU
.Ql [smtp://]server[:port] )
to choose this protocol.
.It
Then the so-called SMTPS which is supposed to live on server port 465
and is automatically SSL/TLS secured.
Unfortunately it never became a standardized protocol and may thus not
be supported by your hosts network service database
\(en in fact the port number has already been reassigned to other
protocols!
.Pp
SMTPS is nonetheless a commonly offered protocol and thus can be
chosen by assigning a value like \*(IN
.Ql smtps://[user[:password]@]server[:port]
(\*(OU
.Ql smtps://server[:port] ) ;
due to the mentioned problems it is usually necessary to explicitly
specify the port as
.Ql :465 ,
however.
.It
Finally there is the SUBMISSION protocol (RFC 6409), which usually
lives on server port 587 and is practically identically to the SMTP
protocol from \*(UA's point of view beside that; it requires setting the
.Va smtp-use-starttls
variable to enter a SSL/TLS secured session state.
Assign a value like \*(IN
.Ql submission://[user[:password]@]server[:port]
(\*(OU
.Ql submission://server[:port] ) .

and the
.Ql HOST
from the content of this variable (or, if that is the empty string,
.Va hostname
or the local hostname as a last resort).
This often allows using an address that is itself valid but hosted by
a provider other than which (in

.It Va spam-interface
\*(OP In order to use any of the spam-related commands (like, e.g.,
.Ic spamrate )
the desired spam interface must be defined by setting this variable.
Please refer to the manual section
.Sx "Handling spam"
for the complete picture of spam handling in \*(UA.
All or none of the following interfaces may be available:
.
.Bl -tag -width ".It Ql _ilte_"
.It Ql spamc
Interaction with
.Xr spamc 1
from the
.Xr spamassassin 1
.Pf ( Lk http://spamassassin.apache.org SpamAssassin )
suite.
Different to the generic filter interface \*(UA will automatically add
the correct arguments for a given command and has the necessary
knowledge to parse the program's output.
A default value for
.Va spamc-command
will have been compiled into the \*(UA binary if
.Xr spamc 1
has been found in
.Ev PATH
during compilation.
Shall it be necessary to define a specific connection type (rather than
using a configuration file for that), the variable
.Va spamc-arguments
can be used as in, e.g.,
.Ql -d server.example.com -p 783 .
It is also possible to specify a per-user configuration via
.Va spamc-user .
Note that this interface doesn't inspect the
.Ql is-spam
flag of a message for the command
.Ic spamforget .
.
.It Ql spamd
\*(UA will directly communicate with the
.Xr spamassassin 1
daemon
.Xr spamd 1
via a path-based
.Xr unix 4
stream socket as specified in
.Va spamd-socket .
It is possible to specify a per-user configuration via
.Va spamd-user .
.
.It Ql filter
generic spam filter support via freely configurable hooks.
This interface is meant for programs like
.Xr bogofilter 1
and
.Xr sylfilter 1
and requires according behaviour in respect to the hooks' exit

The manual section

contains examples for some programs.
.
.Mx
.It Va spamfilter-rate-scanscore
\*(OP Because of the generic nature of the
.Ql filter
.Va spam-interface
spam scores are not supported for it by default, but if the \*(OPtional
regular expression support is available then setting this variable can
be used to overcome this restriction.
It is interpreted as follows: first a number (digits) is parsed that
must be followed by a semicolon
.Ql \&;
and an extended regular expression.
Then the latter is used to parse the first output line of the
.Va spamfilter-rate
hook, and, in case the evaluation is successful, the group that has been
specified via the number is interpreted as a floating point scan score.
.
.Mx
.It Va ssl-ca-dir
\*(OP Specifies a directory with CA certificates in PEM (Pricacy
Enhanced Mail) for verification of of SSL/TLS server certificates.
See

for more information.
.
.Mx

for more information.
.
.Mx Va ssl-cert
.It Va ssl-cert-USER@HOST , ssl-cert-HOST , ssl-cert
\*(OP Variable chain that sets the file name for a SSL/TLS client

function of the OpenSSL library, if available.
.
.Mx Va ssl-cipher-list
.It Va ssl-cipher-list-USER@HOST , ssl-cipher-list-HOST , ssl-cipher-list
\*(OP Specifies a list of ciphers for SSL/TLS connections.
This is a direct interface to the
.Ql CipherString
slot of the
.Xr SSL_CONF_cmd 3
function of the OpenSSL library, if available; see
.Xr ciphers 1
for more information.
By default \*(UA doesn't set a list of ciphers, which in effect will use a
.Va ssl-protocol
specific cipher (protocol standards ship with a list of acceptable
ciphers), possibly cramped to what the actually used SSL/TLS library
supports \(en the manual section
.Sx "An example configuration"
also contains a SSL/TLS use case.
.
.Mx
.It Va ssl-config-file
\*(OP If this variable is set \*(UA will call
.Xr CONF_modules_load_file 3
to allow OpenSSL to be configured according to the host system wide
security settings.
If a non-empty value is given then this will be used to specify the
configuration file to be used instead of the global OpenSSL default;
note that in this case it is an error if the file cannot be loaded.
The application name will always be passed as
.Dq \*(uA .
.
.Mx
.It Va ssl-crl-file
\*(OP Specifies a file that contains a CRL in PEM format to use when
verifying SSL/TLS server certificates.
.
.Mx
.It Va ssl-crl-dir
\*(OP Specifies a directory that contains files with CRLs in PEM format
to use when verifying SSL/TLS server certificates.
.
.Mx Va ssl-key
.It Va ssl-key-USER@HOST , ssl-key-HOST , ssl-key
\*(OP Variable chain that sets the file name for the private key of
a SSL/TLS client certificate.
If unset, the name of the certificate file is used.
The file is expected to be in PEM format.
This is a direct interface to the

function of the OpenSSL library, if available.
.
.Mx Va ssl-method
.It Va ssl-method-USER@HOST , ssl-method-HOST , ssl-method
\*(OB\*(OP Please use the newer and more flexible
.Va ssl-protocol
instead: if both values are set,

.Ql tls1.2
.Pf ( Ql -ALL, TLSv1.2 ) ,
.Ql tls1.1
.Pf ( Ql -ALL, TLSv1.1 ) ,
.Ql tls1
.Pf ( Ql -ALL, TLSv1 )
and
.Ql ssl3
.Pf ( Ql -ALL, SSLv3 ) ;
the special value
.Ql auto
is mapped to
.Ql ALL, -SSLv2
and thus includes the SSLv3 protocol.
Note that SSLv2 is no longer supported at all.
.
.Mx
.It Va ssl-no-default-ca
\*(BO\*(OP Don't load default CA locations to verify SSL/TLS server
certificates.
.
.Mx Va ssl-protocol
.It Va ssl-protocol-USER@HOST , ssl-protocol-HOST , ssl-protocol
\*(OP Specify the used SSL/TLS protocol.
This is a direct interface to the
.Ql Protocol
slot of the
.Xr SSL_CONF_cmd 3
function of the OpenSSL library, if available;
otherwise an \*(UA internal parser is used which understands the
following subset of (case-insensitive) command strings:
.Ql SSLv3 ,
.Ql TLSv1 ,
.Ql TLSv1.1
and
.Ql TLSv1.2 ,
as well as the special value
.Ql ALL .
Multiple specifications may be given via a comma-separated list which
ignores any whitespace.
An optional
.Ql +
plus prefix will enable a protocol, a
.Ql -
minus prefix will disable it, so that
.Ql -ALL, TLSv1.2
will enable only the TLSv1.2 protocol.
.Pp
It depends upon the used TLS/SSL library which protocols are actually
supported and which protocols are used if
.Va ssl-protocol
is not set, but note that SSLv2 is no longer supported at all and
actively disabled.
Especially for older protocols explicitly securing
.Va ssl-cipher-list
may be worthwile, see
.Sx "An example configuration" .
.
.Mx
.It Va ssl-rand-egd
\*(OP Gives the pathname to an entropy daemon socket, see
.Xr RAND_egd 3 .
Not all SSL/TLS libraries support this.
.
.Mx
.It Va ssl-rand-file
\*(OP Gives the filename to a file with random entropy data, see
.Xr RAND_load_file 3 .
If this variable is not set, or set to the empty string, or if the
filename expansion failed, then
.Xr RAND_file_name 3
will be used to create the filename if, and only if,
.Xr RAND_status 3
documents that the SSL PRNG is not yet sufficiently seeded.
If \*(UA successfully seeded the SSL PRNG then it'll update the file via
.Xr RAND_write_file 3 .
This variable is only used if
.Va ssl-rand-egd
is not set (or not supported by the SSL/TLS library).
.
.Mx Va ssl-verify
.It Va ssl-verify-USER@HOST , ssl-verify-HOST , ssl-verify
\*(OP Variable chain that sets the action to be performed if an error
occurs during SSL/TLS server certificate validation.
Valid (case-insensitive) values are
.Ql strict
(fail and close connection immediately),
.Ql ask
(ask whether to continue on standard input),
.Ql warn
(show a warning and continue),
.Ql ignore
(do not perform validation).
The default is
.Ql ask .
.
.Mx
.It Va stealthmua
If only set without an assigned value, then this option inhibits the
generation of the
.Ql Message-ID:
and
.Ql User-Agent:
header fields that include obvious references to \*(UA.
There are two pitfalls associated with this:
First, the message id of outgoing messages is not known anymore.
Second, an expert may still use the remaining information in the header
to track down the originating mail user agent.
If set to the value
.Ql noagent ,
then the mentioned
.Ql Message-ID:
suppression doesn't occur.
.
.
.Mx
.It Va termcap
(\*(OP) This specifies a comma-separated list of
.Lb libterminfo
and/or
.Lb libtermcap
capabilities (see
.Sx "On terminal control and line editor" ,
escape commas with backslash) to be used to overwrite or define entries.
.Sy Note
that this variable will only be queried once at program startup and can
thus only be specified in resource files or on the command line.
.
.Pp
String capabilities form
.Ql cap=value
pairs and are expected unless noted otherwise.
Numerics have to be notated as
.Ql cap#number
where the number is expected in normal decimal notation.
Finally, booleans don't have any value but indicate a true or false
state simply by being defined or not; this indeed means that \*(UA
doesn't support undefining a boolean that normally exists.
The following example defines that the terminal has 256 colours:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set termcap="colors=256"
.Ed
.
.Pp
Keycodes can easily be detected with the command
.Xr cat 1
by running it on an interactive terminal via
.Ql $ cat
(using the
.Fl \&\&v
command line option if available) and pressing some keys: here
.Ql ^[
will stand for
.Ql escape
and
.Ql ^LETTER
for
.Ql control-LETTER
(actually a visualized numeric where
.Ql A
stands for 1 etc.; in fact: the numeric value of
.Ql LETTER
in the US-ASCII character set bitwise XORd with
.Ql 0x40 ,
e.g.,
.Ql $ echo $((0x41 ^ 0x40)) .
Note that
.Ql escape
and other control characters have to be notated as shell-style
escape sequences, e.g.,
.Ql \e033
for (US-ASCII)
.Ql escape
and
.Ql \e001
for
.Ql ^A .
.
.Pp
The following terminal capabilities are or may be meaningful for the
operation of the builtin line editor or \*(UA in general:
.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width yay
.\" HAVE_COLOUR
.It Cd colors Ns \0or Cd Co
.Cd max_colors :
numeric capability specifying the maximum number of colours.
Note that \*(UA doesn't actually care about the terminal beside that,
but always emits ANSI/ISO 6429 escape sequences for producing the
colour and font attributes.
.
.\" HAVE_TERMCAP
.It Cd rmcup Ns \0or Cd te Ns \0/ Cd smcup Ns \0or Cd ti
.Cd exit_ca_mode
and
.Cd enter_ca_mode ,
respectively: exit and enter the alternative screen
.Dq ca-mode ,
effectively turning \*(UA into a fullscreen application.
To disable that, set (at least) one to the empty string.
.
.It Cd smkx Ns \0or Cd ks Ns \0/ Cd rmkx Ns \0or Cd ke
.Cd keypad_xmit
and
.Cd keypad_local ,
respectively: enable and disable the keypad.
This is always enabled if available, because it seems even keyboards
without keypads generate other key codes for, e.g., cursor keys in that
case, and only if enabled we see the codes that we are interested in.
.
.It Cd ed Ns \0or Cd cd
.Cd clr_eos :
clear the screen.
.
.It Cd clear Ns \0or Cd cl
.Cd clear_screen :
clear the screen and home cursor.
(Will be simulated via
.Cd ho
plus
.Cd cd . )
.
.It Cd home Ns \0or Cd ho
.Cd cursor_home :
home cursor.
.
.\" HAVE_MLE
.It Cd el Ns \0or Cd ce
.Cd clr_eol :
clear to the end of line.
(Will be simulated via
.Cd ch
plus repetitions of space characters.)
.
.It Cd hpa Ns \0or Cd ch
.Cd column_address :
move the cursor (to the given column parameter) in the current row.
(Will be simulated via
.Cd cr
plus
.Cd nd . )
.
.It Cd cr
.Cd carriage_return :
move to the first column in the current row.
The default builtin fallback is
.Ql \er .
.
.It Cd cub1 Ns \0or Cd le
.Cd cursor_left :
move the cursor left one space (non-destructively).
The default builtin fallback is
.Ql \eb .
.
.It Cd cuf1 Ns \0or Cd nd
.Cd cursor_right :
move the cursor right one space (non-destructively).
The default builtin fallback is
.Ql \e033[C ,
which is used by most terminals.
Less often occur
.Ql \e033OC
and
.Ql \e014 .

.Mx
.It Va termcap-disable
\*(OP Disable any interaction with a terminal control library.
If set only some generic fallback builtins and possibly the content of
.Va termcap
describe the terminal to \*(UA.
.Sy Note
that this variable will only be queried once at program startup and can
thus only be specified in resource files or on the command line.
.
.Mx
.It Va toplines
If defined, gives the number of lines of a message to be displayed
with the command
.Ic top ;
normally, the first five lines are printed.
.
.Mx
.It Va ttycharset
The character set of the terminal \*(UA operates on,
and the one and only supported character set that \*(UA can use if no
character set conversion capabilities have been compiled into it,
in which case it defaults to ISO-8859-1 unless it can deduce a value
from the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
locale environment.
Refer to the section
.Sx "Character sets"
for the complete picture about character sets.
.
.Mx
.It Va umask
For a safety-by-default policy \*(UA sets its process
.Xr umask 2
to
.Ql 0077 ,
but this variable can be used to override that:
set it to an empty value to don't change the (current) setting,
otherwise the process file mode creation mask is updated to the new value.
Child processes inherit the process file mode creation mask.
.
.Mx Va user
.It Va user-HOST , user
\*(IN Variable chain that sets a global fallback user name, which is
used in case none has been given in the protocol and account-specific
URL.
This variable defaults to the name of the user who runs \*(UA.
.
.Mx
.It Va v15-compat
\*(BO Setting this option enables upward compatibility with \*(UA
version 15.0 in respect to which configuration options are available and
how they are handled.
This manual uses \*(IN and \*(OU to refer to the new and the old way of
doing things, respectively.
.
.Mx
.It Va verbose
\*(BO Setting this option, also controllable via the command line option
.Fl v ,
causes \*(UA to be more verbose, e.g., it will display obsoletion
warnings and SSL/TLS certificate chains.
Even though marked \*(BO this option may be set twice in order to
increase the level of verbosity even more, in which case even details of
the actual message delivery and protocol conversations are shown.
A single
.Pf no Va verbose
is sufficient to disable verbosity as such.

\*(RO \*(UA version information: the first variable contains a string
containing the complete version identification \(en this is identical to

The latter three contain only digits: the major, minor and update
version numbers.
.
.Mx
.It Va writebackedited
If this variable is set messages modified using the
.Ic edit
or
.Ic visual
commands are written back to the current folder when it is quit;
it is only honoured for writable folders in MBOX format, though.
Note that the editor will be pointed to the raw message content in that

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.
The term
.Dq environment variable
should be considered an indication that these variables are either
standardized as vivid parts of process environments, or that they are
commonly found in there.
The process environment is inherited from the
.Xr sh 1
once \*(UA is started, and unless otherwise explicitly noted handling of
the following variables transparently integrates into that of the
.Sx "INTERNAL VARIABLES"
from \*(UA's point of view.
This means that, e.g., they can be managed via
.Ic set
and
.Ic unset ,
causing automatic program environment updates (to be inherited by
newly created child processes).
.
.Pp
In order to transparently integrate other environment variables equally
they need to be imported (linked) with the command
.Ic environ .
This command can also be used to set and unset non-integrated
environment variables from scratch, sufficient system support provided.
The following example, applicable to a POSIX shell, sets the
.Ev COLUMNS
environment variable for \*(UA only, and beforehand exports the
.Ev EDITOR
in order to affect any further processing in the running shell:
.

RFC 1524 defines a
.Dq User Agent Configuration Mechanism
which \*(UA \*(OPally supports.
It defines a file format to be used to inform mail user agent programs
about the locally-installed facilities for handling various data
formats, i.e., about commands and how they can be used to display, edit
etc. MIME part contents, as well as a default path search that includes
multiple possible locations of
.Dq mailcap
files and the
.Ev MAILCAPS
environment variable that can be used to overwrite that (repeating here
that it is not a search path, but instead a path search specification).
Any existing files will be loaded in sequence, appending any content to
the list of MIME type handler directives.
.
.Pp
.Dq Mailcap
files consist of a set of newline separated entries.
Comment lines start with a number sign
.Ql #
(in the first column!) and are ignored.
Empty lines are also ignored.
All other lines form individual entries that must adhere to the syntax
described below.
To extend a single entry (not comment) its line can be continued on
follow lines if newline characters are
.Dq escaped
by preceding them with the backslash character
.Ql \e .
The standard doesn't specify how leading whitespace of follow lines is
to be treated, therefore \*(UA retains it.
.
.Pp
.Dq Mailcap
entries consist of a number of semicolon
.Ql \&;
separated fields, and the backslash
.Ql \e
character can be used to escape any following character including
semicolon and itself.
The first two fields are mandatory and must occur in the specified
order, the remaining fields are optional and may appear in any order.
Leading and trailing whitespace of content is ignored (removed).
.
.Pp
The first field defines the MIME
.Ql TYPE/SUBTYPE
the entry is about to handle (case-insensitively, and no backslash
escaping is possible in this field).
If the subtype is specified as an asterisk
.Ql *
the entry is meant to match all subtypes of the named type, e.g.,
.Ql audio/*
would match any audio type.
The second field defines the shell command which shall be used to
.Dq display
MIME parts of the given type; it is implicitly called the
.Cd view
command.
.
.Pp
For data
.Dq consuming
shell commands message (MIME part) data is passed via standard input
unless the given shell command includes one or more instances of the
(unquoted) string
.Ql %s ,
in which case these instances will be replaced with a temporary filename
and the data will have been stored in the file that is being pointed to.
Likewise, for data
.Dq producing
shell commands data is assumed to be generated on standard output unless
the given command includes (one ore multiple)
.Ql %s .
In any case any given
.Ql %s
format is replaced with a(n already) properly quoted filename.
Note that when a command makes use of a temporary file via
.Ql %s
then \*(UA will remove it again, as if the
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile ,
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-fill
and
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink
flags had been set; see below for more.
.
.Pp
The optional fields either define a shell command or an attribute (flag)
value, the latter being a single word and the former being a keyword
naming the field followed by an equals sign
.Ql =
succeeded by a shell command, and as usual for any
.Dq Mailcap
content any whitespace surrounding the equals sign will be removed, too.
Optional fields include the following:
.
.
.Bl -tag -width textualnewlines
.It Cd compose
A program that can be used to compose a new body or body part in the
given format.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd composetyped
Similar to the
.Cd compose
field, but is to be used when the composing program needs to specify the
.Ql Content-type:
header field to be applied to the composed data.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd edit
A program that can be used to edit a body or body part in the given
format.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd print
A program that can be used to print a message or body part in the given
format.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd test
Specifies a program to be run to test some condition, e.g., the machine
architecture, or the window system in use, to determine whether or not
this mailcap entry applies.
If the test fails, a subsequent mailcap entry should be sought; also see
.Cd x-mailx-test-once .
.
.It Cd needsterminal
This flag field indicates that the given shell command must be run on
an interactive terminal.
\*(UA will temporarily release the terminal to the given command in
interactive mode, in non-interactive mode this entry will be entirely
ignored; this flag implies
.Cd x-mailx-noquote .
.
.It Cd copiousoutput
A flag field which indicates that the output of the
.Cd view
command will be an extended stream of textual output that can be
(re)integrated into \*(UA's normal visual display.
It is mutually exclusive with
.Cd needsterminal
and implies
.Cd x-mailx-always .
.
.It Cd textualnewlines
A flag field which indicates that this type of data is line-oriented and
that, if encoded in
.Ql base64 ,
all newlines should be converted to canonical form (CRLF) before
encoding, and will be in that form after decoding.
(Currently unused.)
.
.It Cd nametemplate
This field gives a file name format, in which
.Ql %s
will be replaced by a random string, the joined combination of which
will be used as the filename denoted by
.Ev NAIL_FILENAME_TEMPORARY .
One could specify that a GIF file being passed to an image viewer should
have a name ending in
.Ql .gif
by using
.Ql nametemplate=%s.gif .
Note that \*(UA ignores the name template unless that solely specifies
a filename suffix that consists of (ASCII) alphabetic and numeric
characters, the underscore and dot only.
.
.It Cd x11-bitmap
Names a file, in X11 bitmap (xbm) format, which points to an appropriate
icon to be used to visually denote the presence of this kind of data.
This field is not used by \*(UA.
.
.It Cd description
A textual description that describes this type of data.
.
.It Cd x-mailx-always
Extension flag field that denotes that the given
.Cd view
command shall be executed even if multiple messages will be displayed
at once.
Normally messages which require external viewers that produce output
which doesn't integrate into \*(UA's visual display (i.e., don't have
.Cd copiousoutput
set) have to be addressed directly and individually.
(To avoid cases where, e.g., a thousand PDF viewer instances are spawned
in sequence.)
.
.It Cd x-mailx-even-if-not-interactive
An extension flag test field \(em by default handlers without
.Cd copiousoutput
are entirely ignored in non-interactive mode, but if this flag is set
then their use will be considered.
It is an error if this flag is set for commands that use the flag
.Cd needsterminal .
.
.It Cd x-mailx-noquote
An extension flag field that indicates that even a
.Cd copiousoutput
.Cd view
command shall not be used to generate message quotes
(as it would be by default).
.
.It Cd x-mailx-async
Extension flag field that denotes that the given
.Cd view
command shall be executed asynchronously, without blocking \*(UA.
Cannot be used in conjunction with
.Cd needsterminal .
.
.It Cd x-mailx-test-once
Extension flag which denotes whether the given
.Cd test
command shall be evaluated once only and the (boolean) result be cached.
This is handy if some global unchanging condition is to be queried, like
.Dq running under the X Window System .
.
.It Cd x-mailx-tmpfile
Extension flag field that requests creation of a zero-sized temporary
file, the name of which is to be placed in the environment variable
.Ev NAIL_FILENAME_TEMPORARY .
It is an error to use this flag with commands that include a
.Ql %s
format.
.
.It Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-fill
Normally the MIME part content is passed to the handler via standard
input; if this flag is set then the data will instead be written into
the implied
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile .
In order to cause deletion of the temporary file you will have to set
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink
explicitly!
It is an error to use this flag with commands that include a
.Ql %s
format.
.
.It Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink
Extension flag field that requests that the temporary file shall be
deleted automatically when the command loop is entered again at latest.
(Don't use this for asynchronous handlers.)
It is an error to use this flag with commands that include a
.Ql %s
format, or without also setting
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile
or
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-fill .
.
.It Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-keep
Using the string
.Ql %s
implies the three tmpfile related flags above, but if you want, e.g.,
.Cd x-mailx-async
and deal with the temporary file yourself, you can add in this flag to
forcefully ignore
.Cd x-mailx-tmpfile-unlink .
.El
.
.
.Pp
The standard includes the possibility to define any number of additional
entry fields, prefixed by
.Ql x- .
Flag fields apply to the entire
.Dq Mailcap
entry \(em in some unusual cases, this may not be desirable, but
differentiation can be accomplished via separate entries, taking
advantage of the fact that subsequent entries are searched if an earlier
one does not provide enough information.
E.g., if a
.Cd view
command needs to specify the
.Cd needsterminal
flag, but the
.Cd compose
command shall not, the following will help out the latter (with enabled
.Va debug
or an increased
.Va verbose
level \*(UA will show information about handler evaluation):
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
application/postscript; ps-to-terminal %s; needsterminal
application/postscript; ps-to-terminal %s; compose=idraw %s
.Ed
.
.Pp
In fields any occurrence of the format string
.Ql %t
will be replaced by the
.Ql TYPE/SUBTYPE
specification.
Named parameters from the
.Ql Content-type:
field may be placed in the command execution line using
.Ql %{
followed by the parameter name and a closing
.Ql }
character.
The entire parameter should appear as a single command line argument,
regardless of embedded spaces; thus:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Message

# Mailcap file
multipart/*; /usr/local/bin/showmulti \e
  %t %{boundary}  ;  composetyped  = /usr/local/bin/makemulti

# Executed shell command
/usr/local/bin/showmulti multipart/mixed 42
.Ed
.
.Pp
.\" TODO v15: Mailcap: %n,%F
Note that \*(UA doesn't support handlers for multipart MIME parts as
shown in this example (as of today).
\*(UA doesn't support the additional formats
.Ql %n
and
.Ql %F .
An example file, also showing how to properly deal with the expansion of

The

file contains user credentials for machine accounts.
The default location in the user's
.Ev HOME
directory may be overridden by the
.Ev NETRC
environment variable.
The file consists of space, tabulator or newline separated tokens.
\*(UA implements a parser that supports a superset of the original BSD
syntax, but users should nonetheless be aware of portability glitches
of that file format, shall their
.Pa .netrc
be usable across multiple programs and platforms:
.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
BSD doesn't support single, but only double quotation marks, e.g.,
.Ql password="pass with spaces" .
.It
BSD (only?) supports escaping of single characters via a backslash
(e.g., a space can be escaped via
.Ql \e\0 ) ,
in- as well as outside of a quoted string.
.It
BSD doesn't require the final quotation mark of the final user input token.
.It
The original BSD (Berknet) parser also supported a format which allowed
tokens to be separated with commas \(en whereas at least Hewlett-Packard
still seems to support this syntax, \*(UA does not!
.It
As a non-portable extension some widely-used programs support
shell-style comments: if an input line starts, after any amount of
whitespace, with a number sign
.Ql # ,
then the rest of the line is ignored.
.It
Whereas other programs may require that the
.Pa .netrc

.Cd password
token for any other
.Cd login
than
.Dq anonymous ,
\*(UA will always require these strict permissions.
.El

Of the following list of supported tokens \*(UA only uses (and caches)
.Cd machine ,

Note that in the example neither

.\" .Ss "Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME" {{{
.Ss "Signed and encrypted messages with S/MIME"
.
\*(OP S/MIME provides two central mechanisms:
message signing and message encryption.
A signed message contains some data in addition to the regular text.
The data can be used to verify that the message was sent using a valid
certificate, that the sender's address in the message header matches
that in the certificate, and that the message text has not been altered.
Signing a message does not change its regular text;
it can be read regardless of whether the recipient's software is able to
handle S/MIME.
.
.Pp
It is thus usually possible to sign all outgoing messages if so desired.
Encryption, in contrast, makes the message text invisible for all people
except those who have access to the secret decryption key.
To encrypt a message, the specific recipient's public encryption key
must be known.
It is therefore not possible to send encrypted mail to people unless their
key has been retrieved from either previous communication or public key
directories.
A message should always be signed before it is encrypted.
Otherwise, it is still possible that the encrypted message text is
altered.
.
.Pp
A central concept to S/MIME is that of the certification authority (CA).
A CA is a trusted institution that issues certificates.
For each of these certificates it can be verified that it really
originates from the CA, provided that the CA's own certificate is
previously known.
A set of CA certificates is usually delivered with OpenSSL and installed
on your system.
If you trust the source of your OpenSSL software installation,
this offers reasonable security for S/MIME on the Internet.
(Otherwise set
.Va ssl-no-default-ca
and use
.Va smime-ca-file
and/or
.Va smime-ca-dir . )
In general, a certificate cannot be more secure than the method its CA
certificate has been retrieved with, though.
Thus if you download a CA certificate from the Internet,
you can only trust the messages you verify using that certificate as
much as you trust the download process.
.
.Pp
The first thing you need for participating in S/MIME message exchange is
your personal certificate, including a private key.
The certificate contains public information, in particular your name and
your email address(es), and the public key that is used by others to
encrypt messages for you,
and to verify signed messages they supposedly received from you.
The certificate is included in each signed message you send.
The private key must be kept secret.
It is used to decrypt messages that were previously encrypted with your
public key, and to sign messages.
.
.Pp
For personal use it is recommended that you get a S/MIME certificate
from one of the major CAs on the Internet using your WWW browser.
Many CAs offer such certificates for free.
There is also
.Lk https://www.CAcert.org
which issues client and server certificates to members of their
community for free; their root certificate
.Pf ( Lk https://\:www.cacert.org/\:certs/\:root.crt )
is often not in the default set of trusted CA root certificates, though,
which means you will have to download their root certificate separately
and ensure it is part of our S/MIME certificate validation chain by
including it in
.Va smime-ca-dir
or as a vivid member of the
.Va smime-ca-file .
But let's take a step-by-step tour on how to setup S/MIME with
a certificate from CAcert.org despite this situation!
.
.Pp
First of all you will have to become a member of the CAcert.org
community, simply by registrating yourself via the web interface.
Once you are, create and verify all email addresses you want to be able
to create signed and encrypted messages for/with using the corresponding
entries of the web interface.
Now ready to create S/MIME certificates, so let's create a new
.Dq client certificate ,
ensure to include all email addresses that should be covered by the
certificate in the following web form, and also to use your name as the
.Dq common name .
.
.Pp
Create a private key and a certificate request on your local computer
(please see the manual pages of the used commands for more in-depth
knowledge on what the used arguments etc. do):
.
.Pp
.Dl openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out creq.pem
.
.Pp
Afterwards copy-and-paste the content of
.Dq creq.pem
into the certificate-request (CSR) field of the web form on the
CAcert.org website (you may need to unfold some
.Dq advanced options
to see the corresponding text field).
This last step will ensure that your private key (which never left your
box) and the certificate belong together (through the public key that
will find its way into the certificate via the certificate-request).
You are now ready and can create your CAcert certified certificate.
Download and store or copy-and-paste it as
.Dq pub.crt .
.

Yay.
In order to use your new S/MIME setup you will have to create
a combined private key/public key (certificate) file:
.
.Pp
.Dl cat key.pem pub.crt > ME@HERE.com.paired
.
.Pp
This is the file \*(UA will work with.
If you have created your private key with a passphrase then \*(UA will
ask you for it whenever a message is signed or decrypted.
Set the following variables to henceforth use S/MIME (setting
.Va smime-ca-file
is of interest for verification only):
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set smime-ca-file=ALL-TRUSTED-ROOT-CERTS-HERE \e
  smime-sign-cert=ME@HERE.com.paired \e
  smime-sign-message-digest=SHA256 \e
  smime-sign
.Ed
.
.Pp
From each signed message you send, the recipient can fetch your
certificate and use it to send encrypted mail back to you.
Accordingly if somebody sends you a signed message, you can do the same,
and use the
.Ic verify
command to check the validity of the certificate.
.
.Pp
Variables of interest for S/MIME signing:
.Va smime-ca-dir ,
.Va smime-ca-file ,
.Va smime-crl-dir ,
.Va smime-crl-file ,
.Va smime-no-default-ca ,
.Va smime-sign ,
.Va smime-sign-cert ,
.Va smime-sign-include-certs
and
.Va smime-sign-message-digest .
.
.Pp
After it has been verified save the certificate via
.Ic certsave
and tell \*(UA that it should use it for encryption for further
communication with that somebody:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
certsave FILENAME
set smime-encrypt-USER@HOST=FILENAME \e
    smime-cipher-USER@HOST=AES256
.Ed
.
.Pp
Additional variables of interest for S/MIME en- and decryption:
.Va smime-cipher
and
.Va smime-encrypt-USER@HOST .
.
.Pp
You should carefully consider if you prefer to store encrypted messages
in decrypted form.
If you do, anybody who has access to your mail folders can read them,
but if you do not, you might be unable to read them yourself later if
you happen to lose your private key.
The
.Ic decrypt
command saves messages in decrypted form, while the
.Ic save , copy ,
and
.Ic move
commands leave them encrypted.
.
.Pp
Note that neither S/MIME signing nor encryption applies to message
subjects or other header fields yet.
Thus they may not contain sensitive information for encrypted messages,
and cannot be trusted even if the message content has been verified.
When sending signed messages,
it is recommended to repeat any important header information in the
message text.

.Ss "Using CRLs with S/MIME or SSL/TLS"
.
\*(OP Certification authorities (CAs) issue certificate revocation
lists (CRLs) on a regular basis.
These lists contain the serial numbers of certificates that have been
declared invalid after they have been issued.
Such usually happens because the private key for the certificate has
been compromised,
because the owner of the certificate has left the organization that is
mentioned in the certificate, etc.
To seriously use S/MIME or SSL/TLS verification,
an up-to-date CRL is required for each trusted CA.
There is otherwise no method to distinguish between valid and
invalidated certificates.
\*(UA currently offers no mechanism to fetch CRLs, nor to access them on
the Internet, so you have to retrieve them by some external mechanism.
.
.Pp
\*(UA accepts CRLs in PEM format only;
CRLs in DER format must be converted, like, e.\|g.:
.
.Pp
.Dl $ openssl crl \-inform DER \-in crl.der \-out crl.pem
.
.Pp
To tell \*(UA about the CRLs, a directory that contains all CRL files
(and no other files) must be created.
The
.Va smime-crl-dir
or
.Va ssl-crl-dir
variables, respectively, must then be set to point to that directory.
After that, \*(UA requires a CRL to be present for each CA that is used
to verify a certificate.

\*(OP \*(UA can make use of several spam interfaces for the purpose of
identification of, and, in general, dealing with spam messages.
A precondition of most commands in order to function is that the
.Va spam-interface
variable is set to one of the supported interfaces.
Once messages have been identified as spam their (volatile)
.Ql is-spam
state can be prompted: the
.Ql Ar :s
and
.Ql Ar :S
message specifications will address respective messages and their
.Va attrlist
entries will be used when displaying the
.Va headline
in the header display.
.
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Ic spamrate
rates the given messages and sets their
.Ql is-spam
flag accordingly.
If the spam interface offers spam scores those can also be displayed in
the header display by including the
.Ql %$
format in the
.Va headline
variable.
.It
.Ic spamham ,
.Ic spamspam
and
.Ic spamforget
will interact with the Bayesian filter of the chosen interface and learn
the given messages as
.Dq ham
or
.Dq spam ,
respectively; the last command can be used to cause
.Dq unlearning
of messages; it adheres to their current
.Ql is-spam
state and thus reverts previous teachings.
.It
.Ic spamclear
and
.Ic spamset
will simply set and clear, respectively, the mentioned volatile
.Ql is-spam
message flag, without any interface interaction.
.El
.
.Pp
The
.Xr spamassassin 1
based
.Va spam-interface Ns s
.Ql spamc
and
.Ql spamd
require a running instance of the
.Xr spamd 1
server in order to function, started with the option
.Fl -allow-tell
shall Bayesian filter learning be possible.
.Ql spamd
only works via a local path-based
.Xr unix 4
socket, but otherwise the following will be equivalently fine:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ spamd -i localhost:2142 -i /tmp/.spamsock -d [-L] [-l]
$ spamd --listen=localhost:2142 --listen=/tmp/.spamsock \e
    --daemonize [--local] [--allow-tell]
.Ed
.
.Pp
Thereafter \*(UA can make use of these interfaces:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ \*(uA -Sspam-interface=spamd -Sspam-maxsize=500000 \e
    -Sspamd-socket=/tmp/.spamsock -Sspamd-user=

$ \*(uA -Sspam-interface=spamc -Sspam-maxsize=500000 \e
    -Sspamc-command=/usr/local/bin/spamc \e
    -Sspamc-arguments="-U /tmp/.spamsock" -Sspamc-user=
or
$ \*(uA -Sspam-interface=spamc -Sspam-maxsize=500000 \e
    -Sspamc-command=/usr/local/bin/spamc \e
    -Sspamc-arguments="-d localhost -p 2142" -Sspamc-user=
.Ed
.
.Pp
Using the generic filter approach allows usage of programs like
.Xr bogofilter 1
and
.Xr sylfilter 1 .
Here is an example for the former, requiring it to be accessible via
.Ev PATH :
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ \*(uA -Sspam-interface=filter -Sspam-maxsize=500000 \e
    -Sspamfilter-ham="bogofilter -n" \e
    -Sspamfilter-noham="bogofilter -N" \e
    -Sspamfilter-nospam="bogofilter -S" \e

    -Sspamfilter-spam="bogofilter -s" \e
    -Sspamfilter-rate-scanscore="1;^(.+)$"
.Ed
.
.Pp
Because messages must exist on local storage in order to be scored (or
used for Bayesian filter training), it is possibly a good idea to
perform the local spam check last:
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
define spamdelhook {
  # Server side DCC
  spamset (header x-dcc-brand-metrics "bulk")
  # Server-side spamassassin(1)
  spamset (header x-spam-flag "YES")

  move :S +maybe-spam
  spamrate :u
  del :s
  move :S +maybe-spam

Since 2014 some free service providers classify programs as

Different to Kerberos / GSSAPI, which is developed since the mid of the

\*(UA doesn't support OAuth.

a
.Xr mail 1
command already appeared in First Edition
.Ux
in 1971:
.
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Electronic mail was there from the start.
Never satisfied with its exact behavior, everybody touched it at one
time or another: to assure the safety of simultaneous access, to improve
privacy, to survive crashes, to exploit uucp, to screen out foreign
freeloaders, or whatever.
Not until v7 did the interface change (Thompson).
Later, as mail became global in its reach, Dave Presotto took charge and
brought order to communications with a grab-bag of external networks
(v8).

Mail was written in 1978 by Kurt Shoens and developed as part of the
.Bx
.Ux
distribution until 1995.
Mail has then seen further development in open source
.Bx
variants, noticeably by Christos Zoulas in
.Pf Net Bx .
Basing upon this Nail, later Heirloom Mailx, was developed by Gunnar
Ritter in the years 2000 until 2008.

.Sh CAVEATS
.
The character set conversion uses and relies upon the
.Xr iconv 3
function.
Its functionality differs widely between the various system environments
\*(UA runs on.
.
.Pp
Limitations with POP3 mailboxes are:
It is not possible to edit messages, they can only be copied and deleted.
The line count for the header display is only appropriate if the entire
message has been downloaded from the server.
The status field of a message is maintained by the server between
connections; some servers do not update it at all, and with a server
that does, the
.Ic exit
command will not cause the message status to be reset.
The
.Ic newmail
command and the
.Va newmail
variable have no effect.
It is not possible to rename or to remove POP3 mailboxes.
.
.Pp
If a
.Dq RUBOUT
(interrupt,
.Ql control-C )
is typed while a POP3 operation is in progress, \*(UA will wait
until the operation can be safely aborted, and will then return to the
command loop and print the prompt again.
When a second
.Dq RUBOUT
is typed while \*(UA is waiting for the operation to complete, the
operation itself will be cancelled.
In this case, data that has not been fetched yet will have to be fetched
before the next command can be performed.
If the cancelled operation was using an SSL/TLS encrypted channel,
an error in the SSL transport will very likely result and render the
connection unusable.
.
.Pp
As \*(UA is a mail user agent, it provides only basic SMTP services.
If it fails to contact its upstream SMTP server, it will not make
further attempts to transfer the message at a later time,
and it does not leave other information about this condition than an
error message on the terminal and an entry in
.Ev DEAD .
This is usually not a problem if the SMTP server is located in the same
local network as the computer on which \*(UA is run.
However, care should be taken when using a remote server of an ISP;
it might be better to set up a local SMTP server then which just acts as
a proxy.
.
.Pp
\*(UA immediately contacts the SMTP server (or
.Xr sendmail 1 ) .
It would not make much sense for \*(UA to defer outgoing mail since SMTP
servers usually provide much more elaborated delay handling than \*(UA
could perform as a client.

.
After deleting some message of a POP3 mailbox the header summary falsely
claims that there are no messages to display, you need to perform
a scroll or dot movement to restore proper state.

In threaded display a power user may encounter crashes very
occasionally (this is may and very).
