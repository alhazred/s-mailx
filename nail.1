.SH DESCRIPTION
\fINail\fR is an intelligent mail processing system, which has
a command syntax reminiscent of
.IR ed (1)
with lines replaced by messages.
It is based on Berkeley Mail 8.1,
is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX
.B mailx
command,
and offers extensions
for MIME messages, IMAP, POP3 and SMTP.
.PP
The following options are accepted:
.TP
.BI \-A \ name
Executes an 
.I account
command (see below)
for \fIname\fR after the startup files have been read.
.TP
.BI \-a \ file
Attach the given file to the message.
.TP
.B \-B
Make standard input and standard output line-buffered.
.TP
.BI \-b \ address
Send blind carbon copies to list.
List should be a comma-separated
list of names.
.TP
.BI \-c \ address
Send carbon copies to list of users.
.TP
.B \-D
Start in
.I disconnected
mode; see the description for the
.I disconnected
variable option.
.TP
.B \-e
Just check if mail is present in the system mailbox.
If yes, return an exit status of zero,
else, a non-zero value.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR [\fIfile\fR]
Read in the contents of your mbox
(or the specified file)
for processing;
when you quit, \fInail\fR writes
undeleted messages back
to this file.
The string \fIfile\fR is handled
as described for the
.I folder
command below.
.TP
.B \-F
Save the message to send
in a file named after the local part
of the first recipient's address.
.TP
.B \-H
Print header summaries for all messages and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fI hops\fR
Invoke sendmail with the specified hop count.
This option has no effect when SMTP is used for sending mail.
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore tty interrupt signals.
This is
particularly useful when using
\fInail\fR on noisy phone lines.
.TP
.B \-I
Shows the `Newsgroup:' or `Article-Id:' fields
in the header summary.
Only applicable in combination with
.IR \-f .
.TP
.B \-n
Inhibits reading /etc/nail.rc upon startup.
.TP
.B \-N
Inhibits the initial display of message headers when reading mail
or editing a mail folder.
.TP
.BI \-q \ file
Start the message with the contents of the specified file.
May be given in send mode only.
.TP
.BI \-r \ address
Sets the
.I From
address. Overrides any
.I from
variable specified in environment or startup files.
Tilde escapes are disabled.
The \fI\-r\fI address\fR options are passed to the mail transfer agent
unless SMTP is used.
.TP
.BI \-s \ subject
Specify subject on command line (only the first argument after the
.I \-s
flag is used as a subject; be careful to quote subjects
containing spaces).
.TP
.BI \-T \ name
Writes the `Message-Id' and `Article-Id' header fields
of each message read in the file
.IR name .
Implies
.IR \-I .
Compressed files are handled as described for the
.I folder
command below.
.TP
.B \-t
The message to be sent is expected to contain a message header
with `To:', `Cc:', or `Bcc:' fields giving its recipients.
Recipients specified on the command line are ignored.
.TP
.BI \-u \ user
Reads the mailbox of the given user name.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
The details of
delivery are displayed on the user's terminal.
.TP
.B \-V
Print \fInail\fR's version and exit.
.TP
.B \-~
Enable tilde escapes even if not in interactive mode.
.SS "Sending mail"
To send a message to one or more people,
\fInail\fR can be invoked with arguments
which are the names of people
to whom the mail will be sent.
You are then expected to type in your message,
followed by an `control-D' at the beginning of a line.
The section below Replying to
or originating mail,
describes some features of \fInail\fR
available to help you compose your letter.
.SS "Reading mail"
In normal usage \fInail\fR is given no arguments
and checks your mail out of the post office,
then prints out a one line header
of each message found.
The current message is initially
the first message (numbered 1)
and can be printed using the print command
which can be abbreviated `p').
You can move among the messages
much as you move between lines in
.IR ed (1),
with the commands `+' and `\-' moving backwards and forwards,
and simple numbers.
.SS "Disposing of mail"
After examining a message
you can delete `d') the message
or reply `r') to it.
Deletion causes the \fInail\fR program
to forget about the message.
This is not irreversible;
the message can be undeleted `u')
by giving its number,
or the \fInail\fR session can be aborted
by giving the exit `x') command.
Deleted messages will, however,
usually disappear never to be seen again.
.SS "Specifying messages"
Commands such as print and delete
can be given a list of message numbers
as arguments to apply to a number of messages at once.
Thus `\fIdelete 1 2\fR' deletes messages 1 and 2,
while `\fIdelete 1-5\fR' deletes messages 1 through 5.
In sorted or threaded mode (see the
.I sort
and
.I thread
commands),
`\fIdelete 1-5\fR' deletes the messages
that are located between (and including) messages 1 through 5
in the sorted/threaded order,
as shown in the header summary.
The following special message names exist:
.TP
.B :n
All new messages.
.TP
.B :o
All old messages (any not in state read or new).
.TP
.B :u
All unread messages.
.TP
.B :d
All deleted messages.
.TP
.B :r
All read messages.
.TP
.BI / string
All messages that contain
.I string
in the subject field (case ignored).
.TP
.I address
All messages from
.IR address .
.TP
.B .
The current message.
.TP
.B ;
The message that was previously the current message.
.TP
.B ,
The parent message of the current message,
that is the message with the Message-ID
given in the `In-Reply-To:' field
or the last entry of the `References:' field
of the current message.
.TP
.B -
The next previous undeleted message,
or the next previous deleted message for the
.I undelete
command.
In sorted/threaded mode,
the next previous such message in the sorted/threaded order.
.TP
.B +
The next undeleted message,
or the next deleted message for the
.I undelete
command.
In sorted/threaded mode,
the next such message in the sorted/threaded order.
.TP
.B ^
The first undeleted message,
or the first deleted message
for the
.I undelete
command.
In sorted/threaded mode,
the first such message in the sorted/threaded order.
.TP
.B $
The last message.
In sorted/threaded mode,
the last message in the sorted/threaded order.
.TP
.BI & x
Only recognized in threaded mode;
selects the message addressed with
.IR x ,
where
.I x
is any other message specification,
and all messages from the thread that begins at it.
If
.I n
is omitted,
the thread beginning with the current message is selected.
.TP
.B *
All messages.
.SS "Replying to or originating mail"
You can use the reply command
to set up a response to a message,
sending it back to the person who it was from.
Text you then type in,
up to an end-of-file,
defines the contents of the message.
While you are composing a message,
\fInail\fR treats lines beginning with the character `~' specially.
For instance, typing `~m' (alone on a line)
will place a copy of the current message into the response
right shifting it by a tabstop
(see indentprefix variable, below).
Other escapes will set up subject fields,
add and delete recipients to the message,
attach files to it
and allow you to escape to an editor
to revise the message
or to a shell to run some commands.
(These options are given in the summary below.)
.SS "Ending a mail processing session"
You can end a \fInail\fR session
with the quit `q') command.
Messages which have been examined
go to your mbox file
unless they have been deleted
in which case they are discarded.
Unexamined messages go back
to the post office.
(See the \-f option above).
.SS "Personal and systemwide distribution lists"
It is also possible to create
a personal distribution lists so that,
for instance, you can send mail
to `\fIcohorts\fR' and have it go
to a group of people.
Such lists can be defined by placing a line like
.nf

        \fBalias\fI cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory\fR

.fi
in the file .mailrc in your home directory.
The current list of such aliases
can be displayed with the alias command in \fInail\fR.
System wide distribution lists can be created
by editing /etc/aliases, see
.IR aliases (5)
and
.IR sendmail (8);
these are kept in a different syntax.
In mail you send,
personal aliases will be expanded
in mail sent to others so that
they will be able to reply to the recipients.
System wide aliases are not expanded when the mail is sent,
but any reply returned to the machine
will have the system wide alias expanded
as all mail goes through sendmail.
.SS "Recipient address specifications"
When an address is used to name a recipient
(in any of To, Cc, or Bcc),
names of local mail folders
and pipes to external commands
can also be specified;
the message text is then written to them.
The rules are: Any name which starts with a
.RB ` | '
character specifies a pipe,
the command string following the `|'
is executed and the message is sent to its standard input;
any other name which contains a
.RB ` @ '
character is treated as a mail address;
any other name which starts with a
.RB ` + '
character specifies a folder name;
any other name which contains a
.RB ` / '
character
but no
.RB ` ! '
or
.RB ` % '
character before also specifies a folder name;
what remains is treated as a mail address.
Compressed folders are handled as described for the
.I folder
command below.
.SS "Network mail (Internet / ARPA, UUCP, Berknet)"
See
.IR mailaddr (7)
for a description of network addresses.
\fINail\fR has a number of options
which can be set in the .mailrc file
to alter its behavior;
thus `\fIset askcc\fR' enables the askcc feature.
(These options are summarized below).
.SS "MIME types"
For any outgoing attachment,
\fInail\fR tries to determine the content type.
It does this by reading MIME type files
whose lines have the following syntax:
.nf

        \fItype\fB/\fIsubtype      extension \fR[\fIextension \fR.\ .\ .]\fR

.fi
where type/subtype are strings describing the file contents,
and extension is the part of a filename starting after the last dot.
Any line not immediately beginning with an ASCII alphabetical character is
ignored by \fInail\fR.
If there is a match with the extension of the file to attach,
the given type/subtype pair is used.
Otherwise, or if the filename has no extension,
the content types text/plain or application/octet-stream are used,
the first for text or international text files,
the second for any file that contains formatting characters
other than newlines and horizontal tabulators.
.SS "Locale"
\fINail\fR uses the LC_CTYPE locale setting
to determine whether a character is printable.
Thus, its value has to match
the character set of the terminal
\fInail\fR runs on.
.SS "Character sets"
If a message contains non-ASCII characters,
the character set being used
must be declared within the header.
Its value can be declared
using the \fIcharset\fR variable.
It is normally assumed
that this is the terminal character set, too.
If the latter differs from the one
that should be used in outgoing mail,
the \fIttycharset\fR variable can be used
for its declaration.
An outgoing message is then converted,
resulting in errors when this process
cannot be done for the entire text;
if the message contains NUL
characters,
it is not converted.
Attachments are never converted.
Any message that is displayed on a terminal
is tried to convert, too,
with characters not in the terminal character set
replaced by question marks.
.SS "Commands"
Each command is typed on a line by itself,
and may take arguments following the command word.
The command need not be typed in its entirety \(en
the first command which matches the typed prefix is used.
For commands which take message lists as arguments,
if no message list is given,
then the next message forward which satisfies
the command's requirements is used.
If there are no messages forward of the current message,
the search proceeds backwards,
and if there are no good messages at all,
\fInail\fR types `\fIapplicable messages\fR' and aborts the command.
If the command begins with a \fI#\fR sign,
the line is ignored.
.PP
The arguments to commands can be quoted, using the following methods:
.IP \(bu
An argument can be enclosed between paired double-quotes
"\|" or single-quotes '\|'; any white space, shell
word expansion, or backslash characters within the quotes
are treated literally as part of the argument.
A double-quote will be treated literally within
single-quotes and vice versa. These special properties of
the quote marks occur only when they are paired at the
beginning and end of the argument.
.IP \(bu
A backslash outside of the enclosing quotes is discarded
and the following character is treated literally as part of
the argument.
.IP \(bu
An unquoted backslash at the end of a command line is
discarded and the next line continues the command.
.PP
Filenames, where expected, are subjected to the following
transformations, in sequence:
.IP \(bu
If the filename begins with an unquoted plus sign, and
the
.I folder
variable is defined,
the plus sign will be replaced by the value of the
.I folder
variable followed by a slash. If the
.I folder
variable is
unset or is set to null, the filename will be unchanged.
.IP \(bu
Shell word expansions are applied to the filename.
If more than a single pathname results
from this expansion and the command is expecting one
file, an error results.
.PP
The following commands are provided:
.TP
.B \-
Print out the preceding message.
If given a numeric argument n,
goes to the n'th previous message and prints it.
.TP
.B ?
Prints a brief summary of commands.
.TP
.B !
Executes the shell (see
.IR sh (1)
and
.IR csh (1))
command which follows.
.TP
.B |
A synonym for the \fIpipe\fR command.
.TP
.B account
(ac) Creates, selects or lists
an email account.
An account is formed by a group of variables.
With two or more arguments,
the first argument gives an account name,
and the following arguments create a group of variables.
With one argument,
the previously created group of variables
for the account name is activated
as described for the
.I set
command,
and a
.I folder
command is executed for the system mailbox or inbox
of that account.
Without arguments,
the list of accounts is printed.
As an example,
.sp
.nf
    account myisp \e
        folder=imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example \e
        record=+Sent \e
        from="myname@myisp.example (My Name)" \e
        smtp=smtp.myisp.example
.fi
.sp
creates an account named `myisp'
which can later be selected by specifying `account myisp'.
.TP
.B alias
(a) With no arguments,
prints out all currently-defined aliases.
With one argument, prints out that alias.
With more than one argument,
creates a new alias or changes an old one.
.TP
.B alternates
(alt) The alternates command is useful
if you have accounts on several machines.
It can be used to inform \fInail\fR
that the listed addresses are really you.
When you reply to messages,
\fInail\fR will not send a copy of the message
to any of the addresses
listed on the alternates list.
If the alternates command is given
with no argument,
the current set of alternate names is displayed.
.TP
.B cache
Only applicable to cached IMAP mailboxes;
takes a message list and reads the specified messages
into the IMAP cache.
.TP
.B cd
Same as chdir.
.TP
.B chdir
(ch) Changes the user's working directory to that specified,
if given.
If no directory is given,
then changes to the user's login directory.
.TP
.B connect
(conn) If operating in disconnected mode on an IMAP mailbox,
switch to online mode and connect to the mail server
while retaining the mailbox status.
See the description of the
.I disconnected
variable for more information.
.TP
.B copy
(c) The copy command does the same thing that
.I save
does,
except that it does not mark the messages
it is used on for deletion when you quit.
Compressed files and IMAP mailboxes are handled as described for the
.I folder
command.
.TP
.B Copy
(C) Similar to
.IR copy ,
but saves the messages in a file named after the local part
of the sender address of the first message.
.TP
.B delete
(d) Takes a list of messages as argument
and marks them all as deleted.
Deleted messages will not be saved in mbox,
nor will they be available for most other commands.
.TP
.B discard
Same as ignore.
.TP
.B disconnect
(disco) If operating in online mode on an IMAP mailbox,
switch to disconnected mode while retaining the mailbox status.
See the description of the
.I disconnected
variable for more information.
A list of messages may optionally be given as argument;
the respective messages are then read into the cache
before the connection is closed.
Thus `disco *' makes the entire current mailbox
available for disconnected use.
.TP
.BR dp \ or \ dt
Deletes the current message
and prints the next message.
If there is no next message,
\fInail\fR says `\fIat EOF\fR'.
.TP
.B echo
Echoes its arguments,
resolving special names
as documented for the folder command.
The escape sequences
`\fB\ea\fR',
`\fB\eb\fR',
`\fB\ec\fR',
`\fB\ef\fR',
`\fB\en\fR',
`\fB\er\fR',
`\fB\et\fR',
`\fB\ev\fR',
`\fB\e\e\fR', and
`\fB\e0\fInum\fR'
are interpreted
as with the
.IR echo (1)
command.
.TP
.B edit
(e) Takes a list of messages
and points the text editor
at each one in turn.
On return from the editor,
the message is read back in.
.TP
.B else
Marks the end of the then-part
of an if statement
and the beginning of the part
to take effect if the condition
of the if statement is false.
.TP
.B endif
Marks the end of an if statement.
.TP
.B exit
(ex or x) Effects an immediate return to the Shell
without modifying the user's system mailbox,
his mbox file,
or his edit file in \-f.
.TP
.B file
(fi) The same as folder.
.TP
.B folders
List the names of the folders in your folder directory.
.TP
.B folder
(fold) The folder command switches
to a new mail file or folder.
With no arguments, it tells you
which file you are currently reading.
If you give it an argument,
it will write out changes
(such as deletions) you have made
in the current file and read in
the new file.
Some special conventions are recognized for the name.
\fB#\fR means the previous file,
\fB%\fR means your system mailbox,
\fB%\fIuser\fR means \fIuser's\fR system mailbox,
\fB&\fR means your mbox file,
and \fB+\fIfile\fI means a \fIfile\fR in your folder directory.
\fB%:\fIfilespec\fR expands to the same value as \fIfilespec\fR,
but the file is handled as a system mailbox
e.\ g. by the mbox and save commands.
If the name matches one of the strings defined with the
.I shortcut
command,
it is replaced by its long form and expanded.
If the name ends with \fB.gz\fR or \fB.bz2\fR,
it is treated as compressed with
.IR gzip (1)
or
.IR bzip2 (1),
respectively.
Likewise, if \fIname\fR does not exist,
but either \fIname\fB.gz\fR or \fIname\fB.bz2\fR exists,
the compressed file is used.
A name of the form
.nf

       \fIprotocol\fB://\fR[\fIuser\fB@\fR]\fIhost\fR[\fB:\fIport\fR][\fB/\fIfile\fR]

.fi
is taken as an Internet mailbox specification.
The supported protocols are currently
.B imap
(IMAP v4r1),
.B imaps
(IMAP with SSL/TLS encryption),
.B pop3
(POP3),
and
.B pop3s
(POP3 with SSL/TLS encryption).
The optional
.I file
part applies to IMAP only;
if it is omitted,
the default `INBOX' is used.
If \fInail\fR is connected to an IMAP server,
a name of the form \fB@\fImailbox\fR
refers to the \fImailbox\fR on that server.
If the `folder' variable refers to an IMAP account,
the special name `%' selects the `INBOX' on that account.
.TP
.B Followup
(F) Similar to
.IR Respond ,
but saves the message in a file
named after the local part of the first recipient's address.
.TP
.B followup
(fo) Similar to
.IR respond ,
but saves the message in a file
named after the local part of the first recipient's address.
.TP
.B followupall
Similar to
.IR followup ,
but responds to all recipients regardless of the
.I flipr
and
.I Replyall
variables.
.TP
.B followupsender
Similar to
.IR Followup ,
but responds to the sender only regardless of the
.I flipr
and
.I Replyall
variables.
.TP
.B Forward
(For) Like
.IR forward ,
but does not add any header lines.
This is not a way to hide the sender's identity,
but useful for sending a message again
to the same recipients.
.TP
.B forward
(for) Takes a list of messages and a user name
and sends each message to the named user.
.TP
.B from
(f) Takes a list of messages
and prints their message headers,
piped through the pager if the output does not fit on the screen.
.TP
.B headers
(h) Lists the current range of headers,
which is an 18-message group.
If a `+' argument is given,
then the next 18-message group is printed,
and if a `\-' argument is given,
the previous 18-message group is printed.
.TP
.B help
A synonym for ?.
.TP
.B hold
(ho, also preserve) Takes a message list
and marks each message therein to be saved
in the user's system mailbox
instead of in mbox.
Does not override the delete command.
.I nail
deviates from the POSIX standard with this command,
as a `next' command issued after `hold'
will display the following message,
not the current one.
.TP
.B if
Commands in \fInail\fR's startup files
can be executed conditionally
depending on whether you are sending
or receiving mail with the if command.
For example, you can do:
.nf

        \fBif \fIreceive\fR
                \fIcommands .\ .\ .\fR
        \fBendif\fR

.fi
An else form is also available:
.nf

        \fBif \fIreceive\fR
                \fIcommands .\ .\ .\fR
        \fBelse\fR
                \fIcommands .\ .\ .\fR
        \fBendif\fR

.fi
Note that the only allowed conditions are
.BR receive ,
.BR send ,
and
.B term
(execute command if standard input is a tty).
.TP
.B ignore
Add the list of header fields named to the ignored list.
Header fields in the ignore list are not printed
on your terminal when you print a message.
This command is very handy for suppression
of certain machine-generated header fields.
The Type and Print commands can be used
to print a message in its entirety,
including ignored fields.
If ignore is executed with no arguments,
it lists the current set of ignored fields.
.TP
.B imap
Sends command strings directly to the current IMAP server.
\fINail\fR operates always in IMAP \fIselected state\fR
on the current mailbox;
commands that change this
will produce undesirable results
and should be avoided.
Useful IMAP commands are:
.RS
.TP
.B create
Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an argument
and creates it.
.TP
.B delete
Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an argument
and deletes it.
.TP
.B getquotaroot
.\" RFC 2087
Takes the name of an IMAP mailbox as an argument
and prints the quotas that apply to the mailbox.
Not all IMAP servers support this command.
.TP
.B list
Takes two arguments,
a \fIreference name\fR
which specifies the desired hierarchy,
and a \fImailbox name\fR
with possible wildcards.
To get a list of all existing IMAP mailboxes,
use `imap list "" *'.
.TP
.B namespace
.\" RFC 2342
Takes no arguments and prints the Personal Namespaces,
the Other User's Namespaces,
and the Shared Namespaces.
Each namespace type is printed in parentheses;
if there are multiple namespaces of the same type,
inner parentheses separate them.
For each namespace,
a namespace prefix and a hierarchy separator is listed.
Not all IMAP servers support this command.
.TP
.B rename
Takes the name of an existing IMAP mailbox as the first argument
and renames it to the name given as second argument.
.TP
.B search
Searches for messages that match the criteria
given as arguments
and prints their IMAP message numbers.
For example,
`imap search body \fIstring\fR'
looks for all messages which contain \fIstring\fR in their body.
.RE
.IP
IMAP message numbers are usually identical
to regular message numbers,
but can change when a message is deleted on the server
by another client or process.
They should thus be used with care;
if in doubt,
use a `print' command to verify them.
The problem does not occur
with regular message numbers
because \fInail\fR internally uses IMAP \fIunique identifiers\fR (UIDs)
to refer to them.
.TP
.B inc
Same as
.IR newmail .
.TP
.B list
Prints the names of all available commands.
.TP
.B Mail
(M) Similar to
.IR mail ,
but saves the message in a file
named after the local part of the first recipient's address.
.TP
.B mail
(m) Takes as argument login names
and distribution group names
and sends mail to those people.
.TP
.B mbox
Indicate that a list of messages be sent
to mbox in your home directory when you quit.
This is the default action for messages
if you do not have the hold option set.
.TP
.B newmail
Checks for new mail in the current folder
without committing any changes before.
If new mail is present, a message is printed.
If the
.I header
variable is set,
the headers of each new message are also printed.
.TP
.B next
(n) like + or CR) Goes to the next message
in sequence and types it.
With an argument list, types the next matching message.
.TP
.B New
Same as
.IR unread .
.TP
.B new
Same as
.IR unread .
.TP
.B online
Same as
.IR connect .
.TP
.B preserve
(pre) A synonym for
.IR hold .
.TP
.B Pipe
(Pi) Like
.I pipe
but also
pipes ignored header fields.
.TP
.B pipe
(pi) Takes a message list and a shell command
and pipes the messages through the command.
Without an argument,
the current message is piped
through the command given by the \fIcmd\fR variable.
If the \fI page\fR variable is set,
every message is followed by a formfeed character.
.TP
.B Print
(P) Like
.I print
but also
prints out ignored header fields.
See also
.IR print ,
.IR ignore ,
and
.IR retain .
.TP
.B print
(p) Takes a message list and types out each message
on the user's terminal.
If the message is a MIME multipart message,
all parts with a content type of `text' or `message' are shown,
the other are hidden except for their headers.
.TP
.B quit
(q) Terminates the session, saving all undeleted,
unsaved messages in the user's mbox file in his login directory,
preserving all messages marked with hold or preserve
or never referenced in his system mailbox,
and removing all other messages from his system mailbox.
If new mail has arrived during the session,
the message `\fIYou have new mail\fR' is given.
If given while editing a mailbox file with the \-f flag,
then the edit file is rewritten.
A return to the Shell is effected,
unless the rewrite of edit file fails,
in which case the user can escape
with the exit command.
.TP
.B Reply
(R) Reply to originator.
Does not reply to other recipients
of the original message.
.TP
.BR reply
(r) Takes a message list and sends mail
to the sender and all recipients of the specified message.
The default message must not be deleted.
.TP
.B replyall
Similar to
.IR reply ,
but responds to all recipients regardless of the
.I flipr
and
.I Replyall
variables.
.TP
.B replysender
Similar to
.IR Reply ,
but responds to the sender only regardless of the
.I flipr
and
.I Replyall
variables.
.TP
.B Respond
Same as
.IR Reply .
.TP
.B respond
Same as
.IR reply .
.TP
.B respondall
Same as
.IR replyall .
.TP
.B respondsender
Same as
.IR replysender .
.TP
.B retain
Add the list of header fields named to the retained list.
Only the header fields in the retain list are shown
on your terminal when you print a message.
All other header fields are suppressed.
The Type and Print commands can be used
to print a message in its entirety.
If retain is executed with no arguments,
it lists the current set of retained fields.
.TP
.B Save
(S)
Similar to
.IR save ,
but saves the messages
in a file named after the local part
of the sender of the first message
instead of taking a filename argument.
.TP
.B save
(s) Takes a message list and a filename
and appends each message
in turn to the end of the file.
If no filename is given,
the mbox file is used.
The filename in quotes,
followed by the line count and character count
is echoed on the user's terminal.
If editing a system mailbox,
the messages are marked for deletion.
Compressed files and IMAP mailboxes are handled as described for the
.I \-f
command line option above.
.TP
.B savediscard
Same as saveignore.
.TP
.B saveignore
Saveignore is to save what ignore is to print and type.
Header fields thus marked are filtered out
when saving a message by save
or when automatically saving to mbox.
This command should only be applied to header fields
that do not contain information needed to decode the message,
as MIME content fields do.
If saving messages on an IMAP account,
ignoring fields makes it impossible
to copy the data directly on the server,
thus operation usually becomes much slower.
.TP
.B saveretain
Saveretain is to save what retain is to print and type.
Header fields thus marked are the only ones
saved with a message when saving by save
or when automatically saving to mbox.
Saveretain overrides saveignore.
The use of this command is strongly discouraged
since it may strip header fields
that are needed to decode the message correctly.
.TP
.B set
(se) With no arguments, prints all variable values,
piped through the pager if the output does not fit on the screen.
Otherwise, sets option.
Arguments are of the form option=value
(no space before or after =)
or option.
Quotation marks may be placed around any part of the
assignment statement to quote blanks
or tabs, i.\|e. `\fIset indentprefix="\->"\fR'.
If an argument begins with
.BR no ,
as in `\fBset no\fIsave\fR',
the effect is the same as invoking the
.I unset
command with the remaining part of the variable
(`\fIunset \fIsave\fR').
.TP
.B shell
(sh) Invokes an interactive version of the shell.
.TP
.B shortcut
Defines a shortcut name and its string for expansion,
as described for the
.I folder
command.
With no arguments,
a list of defined shortcuts is printed.
.TP
.B size
Takes a message list and prints out
the size in characters of each message.
.TP
.B sort
Create a sorted representation of the current folder,
and change the
.I next
command and the addressing modes
such that they refer to messages in the sorted order.
Message numbers are the same as in regular mode.
If the
.I header
variable is set,
a header summary in the new order is also printed.
Possible sorting criteria are:
.RS
.TP
.B date
Sort the messages by their `Date:' field,
that is by the time they were sent.
.TP
.B from
Sort messages by the value of their `From:' field,
that is by the address of the sender.
If the
.I showname
variable is set,
the sender's real name (if any) is used.
.TP
.B size
Sort the messages by their size.
.TP
.B status
Sort the messages by their message status
(new, read, old, etc.).
.TP
.B subject
Sort the messages by their subject.
.TP
.B thread
Create a threaded order,
as with the
.I thread
command.
.TP
.B to
Sort messages by the value of their `To:' field,
that is by the address of the recipient.
If the
.I showname
variable is set,
the recipient's real name (if any) is used.
.RE
.IP
If no argument is given,
the current sorting criterion is printed.
.TP
.B source
The source command reads commands from a file.
.TP
.B thread
(th) Create a threaded representation of the current folder,
i.\|e. indent messages that are replies to other messages
in the header display,
and change the
.I next
command and the addressing modes
such that they refer to messages in the threaded order.
Message numbers are the same as in unthreaded mode.
If the
.I header
variable is set,
a header summary in threaded order is also printed.
.TP
.B top
Takes a message list and prints the top few lines of each.
The number of lines printed is controlled
by the variable toplines
and defaults to five.
.TP
.B touch
Takes a message list
and marks the messages for saving in the
.I mbox
file.
.TP
.B Type
(T) Identical to the Print command.
.TP
.B type
(t) A synonym for print.
.TP
.B unalias
Takes a list of names defined by alias commands
and discards the remembered groups of users.
The group names no longer have any significance.
.TP
.B undelete
(u) Takes a message list and marks each message as not being deleted.
.TP
.B unignore
Removes the header field names
from the list of ignored fields.
.TP
.B Unread
Same as
.IR unread .
.TP
.B unread
(U) Takes a message list and marks each message
as not having been read.
.TP
.B unretain
Removes the header field names
from the list of retained fields.
.TP
.B unsaveignore
Removes the header field names
from the list of ignored fields for saving.
.TP
.B unsaveretain
Removes the header field names
from the list of retained fields for saving.
.TP
.B unset
Takes a list of option names and discards their remembered
values;
the inverse of set.
.TP
.B unshortcut
Deletes the shortcut names given as arguments.
.TP
.B unsort
Disable sorted or threaded mode (see the
.I sort
and
.I thread
commands), return to normal message order
and,
if the
.I header
variable is set,
print a header summary.
.TP
.B unthread
(unth) Same as
.IR unsort .
.TP
.B visual
(v) Takes a message list and invokes the display editor
on each message.
.TP
.B write
(w) For conventional messages,
the body without all headers is written.
The output is converted
to its native format, if necessary.
If the output file exists,
the text is appended.\(emIf a message is in MIME multipart format,
its first part is written to the specified file
as for conventional messages,
and the user is asked for a filename
to save each other part;
if the contents of the first part are not to be saved,
`write /dev/null' can be used.
In non-interactive mode, only the parts of the multipart message
that have a filename given in the part header are written,
the other are discarded.
The original message is never marked for deletion
in the originating mail folder.
For attachments,
the contents of the destination file are overwritten
if the file previously existed.
No special handling of compressed files is performed.
.TP
.B xit
(x) A synonym for exit.
.TP
.B z
\fINail\fR presents message headers in windowfuls
as described under the headers command.
The z command scrolls to the next window of messages.
If an argument is given,
it specifies the window to use.
A number prefixed by `+' or `\-' indicates
that the window is calculated in relation
to the current position.
A number without a prefix specifies an
absolute window number,
and a `$' lets \fInail\fR scroll
to the last window of messages.
.SS "Tilde escapes"
Here is a summary of the tilde escapes,
which are used when composing
messages to perform special functions.
Tilde escapes are only recognized
at the beginning of lines.
The name `\fItilde escape\fR' is somewhat of a misnomer
since the actual escape character can be set
by the option escape.
.TP
.BI ~! command
Execute the indicated shell command,
then return to the message.
.TP
.B ~.
Same effect as typing the end-of-file character.
.TP
.BI ~< filename
Identical to ~r.
.TP
.BI ~<! command
Command is executed using the shell.
Its standard output is inserted into the message.
.TP
\fB~@\fR [\fIfilename\fR .\ .\ . ]
With no arguments, edit the attachment list.
First, the user can edit all existing attachment data.
If an attachment's file name is left empty,
that attachment is deleted from the list.
When the end of the attachment list is reached,
.I nail
will ask for further attachments,
until an empty file name is given.
If \fIfilename\fP arguments are specified,
all of them are appended to the end of the attachment list.
Filenames which contain white space
can only be specified
with the first method (no \fIfilename\fP arguments).
.TP
.B ~A
Inserts the string contained in the
.I Sign
variable
(same as `~i Sign').
The escape sequences `\fB\et\fR' (tabulator) and `\fB\en\fR' (newline)
are understood.
.TP
.B ~a
Inserts the string contained in the
.B sign
variable
(same as `~i sign').
The escape sequences `\fB\et\fR' (tabulator) and `\fB\en\fR' (newline)
are understood.
.TP
.BI ~b "name .\ .\ ."
Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients
but do not make the names visible in the Cc: line
(`blind' carbon copy).
.TP
.BI ~c "name .\ .\ ."
Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients.
.TP
.B ~d
Read the file `dead.letter' from your home directory
into the message.
.TP
.B ~e
Invoke the text editor on the message collected so far.
After the editing session is finished,
you may continue appending text
to the message.
.TP
.BI ~f messages
Read the named messages into the message being sent.
If no messages are specified,
read in the current message.
Message headers currently being ignored
(by the ignore or retain command)
are not included.
.TP
.BI ~F messages
Identical to ~f,
except all message headers are included.
.TP
.B ~h
Edit the message header fields
by typing each one in turn
and allowing the user to append text
to the end or modify the field
by using the current terminal erase and kill characters.
.TP
.BI ~i variable
Insert the value of the specified variable
into the message adding a newline character at the end.
If the variable is unset or empty,
the message remains unaltered.
The escape sequences `\fB\et\fR' (tabulator) and `\fB\en\fR' (newline)
are understood.
.TP
.BI ~m messages
Read the named messages into the message being sent,
indented by a tab or by the value of indentprefix.
If no messages are specified,
read the current message.
Message headers currently being ignored
(by the ignore or retain command)
are not included.
.TP
.BI ~M messages
Identical to ~m, except all message headers are included.
.TP
.B ~p
Print out the message collected so far,
prefaced by the message header fields
and followed by the attachment list, if any.
If the message text is longer than the screen size,
it is piped through the pager.
.TP
.B ~q
Abort the message being sent,
copying the message to
`dead.letter' in your home directory
if save is set.
.TP
.BI ~r filename
Read the named file into the message.
.TP
.BI ~s string
Cause the named string to become the current subject field.
.TP
.BI ~t "name .\ .\ ."
Add the given names to the direct recipient list.
.TP
.B ~v
Invoke an alternate editor
(defined by the VISUAL option)
on the message collected so far.
Usually, the alternate editor
will be a screen editor.
After you quit the editor,
you may resume appending text
to the end of your message.
.TP
.BI ~w filename
Write the message onto the named file.
If the file exists,
the message is appended to it.
.TP
.B ~x
Same as ~q,
except that the message is not saved to the `dead.letter' file.
.TP
.BI ~| command
Pipe the message through the command as a filter.
If the command gives no output or terminates abnormally,
retain the original text of the message.
The command
.IR fmt (1)
is often used
as command to rejustify the message.
.TP
.BI ~: nail-command
Execute the given \fInail\fR command.
Not all commands, however, are allowed.
.TP
.BI ~_ nail-command
Identical to ~:.
.TP
.BI ~~ string
Insert the string of text in the message
prefaced by a single ~.
If you have changed the escape character,
then you should double that character
in order to send it.
.SS "Variable options"
Options are controlled via set and unset commands,
see their entries for a syntax description.
An option is also set
if it is passed to \fInail\fR
as part of the environment
(this is not restricted to specific variables as in the POSIX standard).
A value given in a startup file overrides
a value imported from the environment.
Options may be either binary,
in which case it is only significant
to see whether they are set or not;
or string, in which case the actual value is of interest.
.SS "Binary options"
.PP
The binary options include the following:
.TP
.B allnet
Causes only the local part to be evaluated
when comparing addresses.
.TP
.B append
Causes messages saved in mbox to be appended to the end
rather than prepended.
This should always be set.
.TP
.BR ask \ or \ asksub
Causes \fInail\fR to prompt you for the subject
of each message you send.
If you respond with simply a newline,
no subject field will be sent.
.TP
.B askatend
Causes the prompts for `Cc:' and `Bcc:' lists
to appear after the message has been edited.
.TP
.B askattach
If set, \fInail\fR asks for files to attach at the end of each message.
Responding with a newline indicates not to include an attachment.
.TP
.B askcc
Causes you to be prompted
for additional carbon copy recipients
(at the end of each message if
.I askatend
or
.I bsdcompat
is set).
Responding with a newline
indicates your satisfaction with the current list.
.TP
.B askbcc
Causes you to be prompted
for additional blind carbon copy recipients
(at the end of each message if
.I askatend
or
.I bsdcompat
is set).
Responding with a newline
indicates your satisfaction with the current list.
.TP
.B autoinc
Same as
.IR newmail .
.TP
.B autoprint
Causes the delete command to behave like dp \-
thus, after deleting a message,
the next one will be typed automatically.
.TP
.B autothread
Causes threaded mode (see the
.I thread
command) to be entered automatically
when a folder is opened.
.TP
.B bang
Enables the substitution of `\fB!\fR'
by the contents of the last command line
in shell escapes.
.TP
.B bsdannounce
Causes automatic display of a header summary after executing a
.I folder
command.
.TP
.B bsdcompat
Sets some cosmetical features to traditional BSD style;
has the same affect as setting `askatend' and
all other variables prefixed with `bsd',
setting prompt to `&\ ', and changing the default pager to
.IR more .
.TP
.B bsdflags
Changes the letters printed in the first column of a header summary
to traditional BSD style.
.TP
.B bsdheadline
Changes the display of columns in a header summary
to traditional BSD style.
.TP
.B bsdmsgs
Changes some informational messages
to traditional BSD style.
.TP
.B bsdorder
Causes the `Subject:' field to appear
immediately after the `To:' field
in message headers and with the
.I ~h
tilde command.
.TP
.B bsdset
Changes the output format of the
.I set
command to traditional BSD style.
.TP
.B datefield
The date in a header summary
is normally the date of the mailbox `From\ ' line of the message.
If this variable is set,
the date as given in the `Date:' header field is used,
converted to local time.
.TP
.B debug
Prints debugging messages and disables the actual delivery of messages.
.TP
.B disconnected
When an IMAP mailbox is selected and this variable is set,
no connection to the server is initiated.
Instead, data is obtained from the local cache (see
.IR imap-cache ).
Mailboxes that are not present in the cache
and messages that have not yet entirely been fetched from the server
are not available;
to fetch all messages in a mailbox at once,
the command `copy * /dev/null' can be used
while still in
.I online
mode.
Changes that are made to IMAP mailboxes in disconnected mode
are queued and committed later
when a connection to that server is opened in online mode.
This procedure is not completely reliable
since it cannot be guaranteed that the IMAP unique identifiers (UIDs)
on the server still match the ones in the cache at that time.
Data is saved to `dead.letter' when this problem occurs.
.TP
\fBdisconnected-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
The specified account is handled as described for the
.I disconnected
variable above,
but other accounts are not affected.
.TP
.B dot
The binary option dot causes \fInail\fR to interpret
a period alone on a line
as the terminator of a message you are sending.
.TP
.B editheaders
When a message is edited while being composed,
its header is included in the editable text.
`To:', `Cc:', `Bcc:', and `Subject:' fields
are accepted within the header,
other fields are ignored.
.TP
.B emptybox
If set, an empty mailbox file is not removed.
This may improve the interoperability with other mail user agents
when using a common folder directory.
.TP
.B emptystart
If the mailbox is empty,
\fInail\fR normally prints \fI`No mail for user'\fR
and exits immediately.
If this option is set,
\fInail\fR starts even with an empty mailbox.
.TP
.B flipr
Exchanges the
.I Respond
with the
.I respond
commands and vice-versa.
.TP
.B fullnames
When replying to a message,
\fInail\fR normally removes the comment parts of email addresses,
which by convention contain the full names of the recipients.
If this variable is set,
such stripping is not performed,
and comments are retained.
.TP
.B header
Causes the header summary to be written at startup
and after commands that affect the number of messages
or the order of messages in the current folder;
enabled by default.
.TP
.B hold
This option is used to hold messages
in the system mailbox by default.
.TP
.B ignore
Causes interrupt signals from your terminal
to be ignored and echoed as @'s.
.TP
.B ignoreeof
An option related to dot is ignoreeof
which makes \fInail\fR refuse to
accept a control-d as the end of a message.
Ignoreeof also applies to \fInail\fR command mode.
.TP
.B imap-use-starttls
Causes
.I nail
to issue a STARTTLS command
to make an unencrypted IMAP session SSL/TLS encrypted.
This functionality is not supported by all servers,
and is not used if the session is already encrypted by the IMAPS method.
.TP
\fBimap-use-starttls-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Activates
.I imap-use-starttls
for a specific account.
.TP
.B keep
This option causes \fInail\fR to truncate your system mailbox
instead of deleting it when it is empty.
This should always be set,
since it prevents malicious users
from creating fake mail folders
in a world-writable spool directory.
.TP
.B keepsave
When you save a message,
\fInail\fR usually discards it
from the originating folder
when you quit.
To retain all saved messages,
set this option.
.TP
.B metoo
Usually, when a group is expanded
that contains the sender,
the sender is removed from the expansion.
Setting this option causes
the sender to be included in the group.
.TP
.B newmail
Checks for new mail in the current folder
each time the prompt is printed.
For IMAP mailboxes,
the server is then polled for new mail,
which may result in delayed operation
if the connection to the server is slow.
.IP
If this variable is set to the special value
.BR nopoll ,
the server is not actively asked for new mail,
but new mail may still be detected and announced
with any other IMAP command that is sent to the server.
.IP
In any case,
the IMAP server may send notifications about messages
that have been deleted on the server
by another process or client.
In this case, `Expunged \fIn\fR messages' is printed
regardless of this variable,
and message numbers may have changed.
.TP
.B noheader
Setting the option noheader is the same
as giving the \-N flag on the command line.
.TP
.B outfolder
Causes the filename given in the
.I record
variable
and the sender-based filenames for the
.I Copy
and
.I Save
commands
to be interpreted relative to the directory given in the
.I folder
variable rather than to the current directory
unless it is an absolute pathname.
.TP
.B page
If set, each message the \fIpipe\fR command prints out
is followed by a formfeed character.
.TP
.B piperaw
Send messages to the
.I pipe
command without performing MIME and character set conversions.
.TP
.B pop3-use-apop
If this variable is set,
the APOP authentication method is used
when a connection to a POP3 server is initiated.
The advantage of this method over the usual USER/PASS authentication is
that the password is not sent over the network in clear text.
The connection fails
if the server does not support the APOP command.
.TP
\fBpop3-use-apop-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Enables
.I pop3-use-apop
for a specific account.
.TP
.B pop3-use-starttls
Causes
.I nail
to issue a STLS command
to make an unencrypted POP3 session SSL/TLS encrypted.
This functionality is not supported by all servers,
and is not used if the session is already encrypted by the POP3S method.
.TP
\fBpop3-use-starttls-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Activates
.I pop3-use-starttls
for a specific account.
.TP
.B print-all-chars
This option causes all characters to be considered printable.
It is only effective if given in a startup file.
With this option set,
some character sequences in messages
may put the user's terminal in an undefined state
when printed;
it should only be used as a last resort
if no working system locale can be found.
.TP
.B quiet
Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.
.TP
.B Replyall
Reverses the sense of reply and Reply commands.
.TP
.B save
When you abort a message
with two RUBOUT (interrupt characters)
\fInail\fR copies the partial letter
to the file `dead.letter' in your home directory.
This option is set by default.
.TP
.B searchheaders
If this option is set, then
a message-list specifier in the form `\fI/x:y\fR'
will expand to all messages containing
the substring `\fIy\fR' in the header field `\fIx\fR'.
The string search is case insensitive.
.TP
.B sendwait
When sending a message,
wait until the mail transfer agent exits
before accepting further commands.
If the mail transfer agent returns a non-zero exit status,
the exit status of nail will also be non-zero.
.TP
.B showlast
Setting this option causes \fInail\fR to start at the
last message instead of the first one when opening a mail folder.
.TP
.B showname
Causes
.I nail
to use the sender's real name instead of the plain address
in the header field summary and in message specifications.
.TP
.B showto
Causes the recipient of the message to be shown in the header summary
if the message was sent by the user.
.TP
.B smtp-use-starttls
Causes \fInail\fR to issue a STARTTLS command
to make an SMTP session SSL/TLS encrypted.
Not all servers support this command;
because of common implementation defects,
it cannot be automatically determined
whether a server supports it or not.
.TP
.B ssl-no-default-ca
Do not load the default CA locations
to verify SSL/TLS server certificates.
.TP
.B ssl-v2-allow
Accept SSLv2 connections.
These are normally not allowed
because this protocol version is insecure.
.TP
.B stealthmua
Inhibits the generation of
the \fI`Message-Id:'\fR and \fI`User-Agent:'\fR
header fields that include obvious references to \fInail\fR.
There are two pitfalls associated with this:
First, the message id of outgoing messages is not known anymore.
Second, an expert may still use the remaining information in the header
to track down the originating mail user agent.
.TP
.B verbose
Setting the option verbose is the same
as using the \-v flag on the command line.
When \fInail\fR runs in verbose mode,
details of the actual message delivery
and protocol conversations for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP
are displayed on the user's terminal.
This is sometimes useful to debug problems with specific servers.
.I Nail
prints all data that is sent to remote servers in clear texts,
including passwords,
so care should be taken that no unauthorized option
can view the screen if this option is enabled.
.SS "String Options"
.PP
The string options include the following:
.TP
.B autobcc
Specifies a list of recipients to which
a blind carbon copy of each outgoing message
will be sent automatically.
.TP
.B autocc
Specifies a list of recipients to which
a carbon copy of each outgoing message
will be sent automatically.
.TP
.B autosort
Causes sorted mode (see the
.I sort
command) to be entered automatically
with the value of this option as sorting method
when a folder is opened.
.TP
.B charset
The name of the character set used by \fInail\fR.
If unset, \fIiso-8859-1\fR is the default.
The character set
of all outgoing messages
that contain non-ASCII characters
is declared using its value.
.TP
.B cmd
The default value for the \fIpipe\fR command.
.TP
.B crt
The valued option crt is used as a threshold
to determine how long a message must be
before PAGER is used to read it.
If crt is set without a value,
then the height of the terminal screen stored in the system
is used to compute the threshold (see
.IR stty (1)).
.TP
.B DEAD
The name of the file to use
for saving aborted messages.
This defaults to `dead.letter'
in the user's home directory.
.TP
.B EDITOR
Pathname of the text editor to use
in the edit command and ~e escape.
If not defined,
then a default editor is used.
.TP
.B encoding
The default MIME encoding to use
in outgoing text messages and message parts.
Valid values are \fI8bit\fR or \fIquoted-printable\fR.
The default is \fI8bit\fR.
In case the mail transfer system
is not ESMTP compliant,
\fIquoted-printable\fR should be used instead.
If there is no need to encode a message,
\fI7bit\fR transfer mode is used,
without regard to the value of this variable.
Binary data is always encoded in \fIbase64\fR mode.
.TP
.B escape
If defined, the first character of this option
gives the character to use in the place of ~ to denote escapes.
.TP
.B folder
The name of the directory to use
for storing folders of messages.
All folder names that begin with `+'
refer to files below that directory.
If the directory name begins with a `/',
\fInail\fR considers it to be an absolute pathname;
otherwise, the folder directory is found
relative to your home directory.
.IP
The directory name may also refer to an IMAP account;
any names that begin with `+'
then refer to IMAP mailboxes on that account.
An IMAP folder is normally given in the form
.sp
.nf
    imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example
.fi
.sp
In this case,
the `+' and `@' prefixes for folder names
have the same effect
(see the
.I folder
command).
.IP
Some IMAP servers do not accept the creation of mailboxes
in the hierarchy base;
they require that they are created as subfolders of `INBOX'.
With such servers,
a folder name of the form
.sp
.nf
    imaps://mylogin@imap.myisp.example/INBOX.\&
.fi
.sp
should be used
(the last character is the server's hierarchy delimiter).
Folder names prefixed by `+' will then refer to folders below `INBOX',
while folder names prefixed by `@'
refer to folders below the hierarchy base.
See the
.I imap namespace
command for a method to detect the appropriate prefix and delimiter.
.TP
.B from
The address to put into the \fI`From:'\fR field of the message header.
If replying to a message,
this address is handled as if it were in the alternates list.
.\" If this variable is set,
.\" a \fI`Sender:'\fR field containing the user's name
.\" is also generated,
.\" unless the variable \fIsmtp\fR is set
.\" and its value differs from \fIlocalhost\fR.
If the machine's hostname is not valid at the Internet
(for example at a dialup machine),
you have to set this variable
or
.I hostname
to get correct Message-ID header fields.
.TP
.B hostname
Use this string as hostname
when expanding local addresses
instead of the value obtained from
.IR uname (2)
and
.IR getaddrinfo (3).
.TP
.B imap-auth
Sets the IMAP authentication method.
Valid values are `login' for the usual password-based authentication
(the default),
`cram-md5', which is a password-based authentication
that does not send the password over the network in clear text,
and `gssapi' for GSSAPI-based authentication.
.TP
\fBimap-auth-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Sets the IMAP authentication method for a specific account.
.TP
.B imap-cache
Enables caching of IMAP mailboxes.
The value of this variable must point to a directory
that is either existent or can be created by
.IR nail .
All contents of the cache can be deleted by
.I nail
at any time;
it is not safe to make assumptions about them.
.TP
.B imap-keepalive
IMAP servers may close the connection
after a period of inactivity;
the standard requires this to be at least 30 minutes,
but practical experience may vary.
Setting this variable to a numeric
.I value
greater than 0
causes a NOOP command to be sent each
.I value
seconds if no other operation is performed.
.TP
.B indentprefix
String used by the `\fI~m\fR' and `\fI~M\fR' tilde escapes
and by the \fIquote\fR option
for indenting messages,
in place of the normal tab character (^I).
Be sure to quote the value
if it contains spaces or tabs.
.TP
.B LISTER
Pathname of the directory lister
to use in the
.I folders
command
when operating on local mailboxes.
Default is /bin/ls.
.TP
.B MAIL
Is used as the user's mailbox, if set.
Otherwise, a system-dependent default is used.
Can be a
\fIprotocol\fB://\fR
string (see the
.I folder
command for more information).
.TP
.B MAILX_HEAD
A string to put at the beginning of each new message.
The escape sequences `\fB\et\fR' (tabulator) and `\fB\en\fR' (newline)
are understood.
.TP
.B MAILX_TAIL
A string to put at the end of each new message.
The escape sequences `\fB\et\fR' (tabulator) and `\fB\en\fR' (newline)
are understood.
.TP
.B MBOX
The name of the mbox file.
It can be the name of a folder.
The default is `\fImbox\fR'
in the user's home directory.
.TP
.B NAIL_EXTRA_RC
The name of an optional startup file
to be read after ~/.mailrc.
This variable is ignored if it is imported from the environment;
it has an effect only if it is set in /etc/nail.rc or ~/.mailrc
to allow bypassing the configuration with e. g. `MAILRC=/dev/null'.
Use this file for
.I nail
commands
that are not understood by other mailx implementations.
.TP
.B ORGANIZATION
The value to put into the \fI`Organization:'\fR field of the message header.
.TP
.B PAGER
Pathname of the program to use
in the more command
or when crt variable is set.
The default paginator
.IR pg (1)
or, in BSD compatibility mode,
.IR more (1)
is used
if this option is not defined.
.TP
\fBpassword-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Set the password for
.I user
when connecting to
.IR host .
If no such variable is defined for a host,
the user will be asked for a password on standard input.
Specifying passwords in a startup file
is generally a security risk,
the file should be readable
by the invoking user only.
.TP
.BI pipe- content/subcontent
When a MIME message part of
.I content/subcontent
type is displayed or it is replied to,
its text is filtered through the value of this variable
interpreted as a shell command.
Special care must be taken when using such commands
as mail viruses may be distributed by this method;
if messages of type
.I application/x-sh
were filtered through the shell, for example,
a message sender could easily execute arbitrary code
on the system
.I nail
is running on.
.TP
.B pop3-keepalive
POP3 servers may close the connection
after a period of inactivity;
the standard requires this to be at least 10 minutes,
but practical experience may vary.
Setting this variable to a numeric
.I value
greater than 0
causes a NOOP command to be sent each
.I value
seconds if no other operation is performed.
.TP
.B prompt
The string printed when a command is accepted.
Defaults to `\fB?\ \fR',
or to `\fB&\ \fR' if the
.I bsdcompat
variable is set.
.TP
.B quote
If set, \fInail\fR starts a replying message with the original message prefixed
by the value of the variable \fIindentprefix\fR.
Normally, a heading consisting of `Fromheaderfield wrote:' is printed
before the quotation.
If the string \fInoheading\fR is assigned to the \fIquote\fR variable,
this heading is omitted.
If the string \fIheaders\fR is assigned,
the headers selected by the ignore/retain commands
are printed above the message body,
thus \fIquote\fR acts like an automatic ~m command then.
If the string \fIallheaders\fR is assigned,
all headers are printed above the message body,
thus \fIquote\fR acts like an automatic ~M command then.
.TP
.B record
If defined, gives the pathname of the folder
used to record all outgoing mail.
If not defined,
then outgoing mail is not so saved.
When saving to this folder fails,
the message is not sent
but saved to the `dead.letter' file instead.
.TP
.B replyto
A list of addresses to put into the \fI`Reply-To:'\fR field
of the message header.
If replying to a message, such addresses are handled
as if they were in the alternates list.
.TP
.B screen
When \fInail\fR initially prints the message headers,
it determines the number to print
by looking at the speed of your terminal.
The faster your terminal, the more it prints.
This option overrides this calculation
and specifies how many message headers
you want printed.
This number is also used
for scrolling with the z command.
.TP
.B sendmail
To use an alternate mail delivery system,
set this option to the full pathname
of the program to use.
This should be used with care.
.TP
.B SHELL
Pathname of the shell to use
in the ! command and the ~! escape.
A default shell is used
if this option is not defined.
.TP
.TP
.B Sign
A string for use with the
.I ~A
command.
.TP
.B sign
A string for use with the
.I ~a
command.
.TP
.B signature
Must correspond to the name of a readable file if set.
The file's content is then appended to each singlepart message
and to the first part of each multipart message.
Be warned that there is no possibility
to edit the signature for an individual message.
.TP
.B smtp
Normally, \fInail\fR invokes
.IR sendmail (8)
directly to transfer messages.
If the \fIsmtp\fR variable is set, a SMTP connection to
the server specified by the value of this variable
is used instead.
If the SMTP server does not use the standard port,
a value of \fIserver:port\fR can be given,
with \fIport\fR as a name or as a number.
.IP
There are two possible methods to get SSL/TLS encrypted SMTP sessions:
First, the STARTTLS command can be used to encrypt a session
after it has been initiated,
but before any user-related data has been sent; see
.I \%smtp-use-starttls
above.
Second, some servers accept sessions that are encrypted
from their beginning on. This mode is configured by assigning
\fBsmtps://\fIserver\fR[\fB:\fIport\fR]
to the
.I smtp
variable.
.TP
.B smtp-auth
Sets the SMTP authentication method.
If set to `login',
or if unset and both smtp-auth-user and smtp-auth-password are set,
AUTH LOGIN is used.
If set to `cram-md5',
AUTH CRAM-MD5 is used.
Otherwise,
no SMTP authentication is performed.
.TP
\fBsmtp-auth-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Overrides
.I smtp-auth
for specific values of sender addresses,
depending on the
.I from
variable.
.TP
.B smtp-auth-password
Sets the global password for SMTP AUTH.
Both user and password have to be given
for AUTH LOGIN and AUTH CRAM-MD5.
.TP
\fBsmtp-auth-password-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Overrides
.I smtp-auth-password
for specific values of sender addresses,
depending on the
.I from
variable.
.TP
.B smtp-auth-user
Sets the global user name for SMTP AUTH.
Both user and password have to be given
for AUTH LOGIN and AUTH CRAM-MD5.
.TP
\fBsmtp-auth-user-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Overrides
.I smtp-auth-user
for specific values of sender addresses,
depending on the
.I from
variable.
.TP
.B ssl-ca-dir
Specifies a directory with CA certificates for verification.
See
.IR SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations (3)
for more information.
.TP
.B ssl-ca-file
Specifies a file with CA certificates for verification.
See
.IR SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations (3)
for more information.
.TP
.B ssl-cert
Sets the file name 
for a SSL/TLS client certificate
required by some servers.
.TP
\fBssl-cert-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Sets an account-specific file name
for a SSL/TLS client certificate
required by some servers.
Overrides
.I ssl-cert
for the specified account.
.TP
.B ssl-cipher-list
Specifies a list of ciphers for SSL/TLS connections.
See ciphers(1) for more information.
.TP
.B ssl-key
Sets the file name
for the private key of a SSL/TLS client certificate.
If unset, the name of the certificate file is used.
The file is expected to be in PEM format.
.TP
\fBssl-key-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Sets an account-specific file name
for the private key of a SSL/TLS client certificate.
Overrides
.I ssl-key
for the specified account.
.TP
.B ssl-method
Selects a SSL/TLS protocol version;
valid values are `ssl2', `ssl3', and `tls1'.
If unset, the method is selected automatically,
if possible.
.TP
\fBssl-method-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Overrides
.I ssl-method
for a specific account.
.TP
.B ssl-rand-egd
Gives the pathname to an entropy daemon socket,
see
.IR RAND_egd (3).
.TP
.B ssl-rand-file
Gives the pathname to a file with entropy data,
see
.IR RAND_load_file (3).
If the file is a regular file writable by the invoking user,
new data is written to it after it has been loaded.
.TP
.B ssl-verify
Sets the action to be performed if an error occurs
during SSL/TLS server certificate validation.
Valid values are
`strict' (fail and close connection immediately),
`ask' (ask whether to continue on standard input),
`warn' (print a warning and continue),
`ignore' (do not perform validation).
The default is `ask'.
.TP
\fBssl-verify-\fIuser\fB@\fIhost\fR
Overrides
.I ssl-verify
for a specific account.
.TP
.B toplines
If defined, gives the number of lines
of a message to be printed out
with the top command;
normally, the first five
lines are printed.
.TP
.B ttycharset
The character set of the terminal \fInail\fR operates on.
There is normally no need to set this variable
since \fInail\fR can determine this automatically
by looking at the LC_CTYPE locale setting;
if this succeeds, the value is assigned at startup
and will be displayed by the \fIset\fP command.
Note that this is not necessarily a character set name
that can be used in Internet messages.
If unset, its default is the value of the charset variable.
.TP
.B VISUAL
Pathname of the text editor to use
in the visual command and ~v escape.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Besides the variables described above, \fInail\fR uses
the following environment strings:
.TP
.B HOME
The user's home directory.
.TP
\fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR, \fBLC_COLLATE\fR, \fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP
.B MAILRC
Is used as startup file instead of ~/.mailrc if set.
.TP
.B NAILRC
If this variable is set and
.I MAILRC
is not set,
it is read as startup file.
.TP
.B TMPDIR
Used as directory for temporary files instead of /tmp, if set.
.SH FILES
.TP
~/.mailrc
File giving initial commands.
.TP
/etc/nail.rc
System wide initialization file.
.TP
~/.mime.types
Personal MIME types.
.TP
/etc/mime.types
System wide MIME types.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "IMAP or POP3 client setup"
First you need the following data from your ISP:
the host name of the IMAP or POP3 server,
user name and password for this server,
and a notice whether the server uses SSL/TLS encryption.
Assuming the host name is `server.myisp.example'
and your user name for that server is `mylogin',
you can refer to this account using the
.I folder
command or
.I \-f
command line option with
.nf

    \fBimaps://\fImylogin\fB@\fIserver.myisp.example\fR

.fi
(This string is not necessarily the same as your Internet mail address.)
You can replace `imaps://' with `imap://'
if the server does not support SSL/TLS,
or use `pop3s://' or `pop3://' if the server does not offer IMAP.
You should use IMAP if you can, though;
first because it requires fewer network operations than POP3
to get the contents of the mailbox
and is thus faster;
and second because message flags
are maintained by the IMAP server,
so you can easily distinguish new and old messages
each time you connect.
Even if the server does not accept IMAPS or POP3S connections,
it is possible that it supports the STARTTLS method
to make a session SSL/TLS encrypted
after the initial connection has been performed,
but before authentication begins.
The only reliable method to see if this works is to try it; enter one of
.nf

    \fBset imap-use-starttls\fR
    \fBset pop3-use-starttls\fR

.fi
before you initiate the connection.
.PP
As you probably want messages to be deleted from this account
after saving them,
prefix it with `\fI%:\fR'.
The
.I shortcut
command can be used to avoid typing that many characters
every time you want to connect:
.nf

    \fBshortcut \fImyisp\fB \fB%:imaps://\fImylogin\fB@\fIserver.myisp.example\fR

.fi
You might want to put this string into a startup file.
As the
.I shortcut
command is
.IR nail- specific
and will confuse other
.I mailx
implementations,
it should not be used in
.IR ~/.mailrc ,
instead, put
.nf

    \fBset NAIL_EXTRA_RC=\fI~/.nailrc\fR

.fi
in
.I ~/.mailrc
and create a file
.I ~/.nailrc
containing the
.I shortcut
command above.
You can then access your remote mailbox by invoking
`nail \-f \fImyisp\fR' on the command line,
or by executing `fi \fImyisp\fR' within nail.
.PP
If you want to use more than one IMAP mailbox on a server,
or if you want to use the IMAP server for mail storage too,
the
.I account
command
(which is also \fInail-\fRspecific)
is more appropriate than the
.I shortcut
command.
You can put the following in
.IR ~/.nailrc :
.sp
.nf
    \fBaccount \fImyisp \fR\e
        \fBfolder=imaps://\fImylogin\fB@\fIserver.myisp.example \fR\e
        \fBrecord=+\fISent \fBMBOX=+\fImbox \fBoutfolder\fR
.fi
.sp
and can then access incoming mail for this account by invoking
`nail \-A \fImyisp\fR' on the command line,
or by executing `ac \fImyisp\fR' within nail.
After that,
a command like `copy \fI1\fR +\fIotherfolder\fR'
will refer to \fIotherfolder\fR on the IMAP server.
In particular,
`fi &' will change to the
.I mbox
folder,
and
`fi +Sent' will show your recorded sent mail,
with both folders located on the IMAP server.
.PP
.I Nail
will ask you for a password string
each time you connect to a remote account.
If you can reasonably trust the security
of your workstation,
you can give this password in the startup file as
.nf

    \fBset password-\fImylogin\fB@\fIserver.myisp.example\fB="\fISECRET\fB"\fR

.fi
You should change the permissions of this file to 0600, see
.IR chmod (1).
.PP
.I Nail
supports different authentication methods for both IMAP and POP3.
If Kerberos is used at your location,
you can try to activate GSSAPI-based authentication by
.nf

    \fBset imap-auth=gssapi\fR

.fi
The advantage of this method is that
.I nail
does not need to know your password at all,
nor needs to send sensitive data over the network.
Otherwise, the options
.nf

    \fBset imap-auth=cram-md5\fR
    \fBset pop3-use-apop\fR

.fi
for IMAP and POP3, respectively,
offer authentication methods
that avoid to send the password in clear text over the network,
which is especially important if SSL/TLS cannot be used.
If the server does not offer any of these authentication methods,
conventional user/password based authentication must be used.
It is sometimes helpful to set the
.I verbose
option when authentication problems occur.
.I Nail
will display all data sent to the server in clear text on the screen
with this option,
including passwords.
You should thus take care that no unauthorized person
can look at your terminal when this option is set.
.PP
If you regularly use the same workstation
to access IMAP accounts,
you can greatly enhance performance
by enabling local caching of IMAP messages.
For any message that has been fully or partially fetched from the server,
a local copy is made and is used when the message is accessed again,
so most data is transferred over the network once only.
To enable the IMAP cache,
select a local directory name and put
.nf

    \fBset imap-cache=\fI~/localdirectory\fR

.fi
in the startup file.
All files within that directory
can be overwritten or deleted by \fInail\fR at any time,
so you should not use the directory to store other information.
.PP
Once the cache contains some messages,
it is not strictly necessary anymore
to open a connection to the IMAP server
to access them.
When \fInail\fR is invoked with the \fI\-D\fR option,
or when the
.I disconnected
variable is set,
only cached data is used
for any folder you open.
Messages that have not yet been completely cached
are not available then,
but all other messages can be handled
as usual.
Changes made to IMAP mailboxes in
.I disconnected
mode are committed to the IMAP server
next time it is used in
.I online
mode.
Synchronizing the local status
with the status on the server
is thus partially within your responsibility;
if you forget to initiate a connection to the server again
before you leave your location,
changes made on one workstation
are not available on others.
Also if you alter IMAP mailboxes from a workstation
while uncommitted changes are still pending on another,
the latter data may become invalid.
The same might also happen because of internal server status changes.
You should thus carefully evaluate this feature in your environment
before you rely on it.
.PP
Many POP3 servers will close the connection
after a short period of inactivity. Use
.nf

    \fBset pop3-keepalive=\fI30\fR

.fi
to send a keepalive message each 30 seconds.
A similar
.I imap-keepalive
variable is also available,
but since IMAP servers tend to wait much longer
until they close an idle connection,
it is usually not necessary to activate it.
.PP
If you encounter problems connecting to a SSL/TLS server,
try the
.I ssl-rand-egd
and
.I ssl-rand-file
variables (see the OpenSSL FAQ for more information)
or specify the protocol version with
.IR ssl-method .
Contact your ISP
if you need a client certificate
or if verification of the server certificate fails.
If the failed certificate is indeed valid,
fetch its CA certificate by executing
.nf

    \fBopenssl s_client </dev/null \-showcerts \-connect \e
           \fIserver.myisp.example\fB:\fIimaps\fB 2>&1 | tee \fIlog\fR

.fi
(see
.IR s_client (1))
and put it into the file specified with
.IR ssl-ca-file .
The data you need is located at the end of the certificate chain
within (and including) the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE'
and `END CERTIFICATE' lines.
(Note that it is possible to fetch
a forged certificate by this method.
You can only completely rely
on the authenticity of the CA certificate
if you fetch it in a way that is trusted by other means,
such as by personally receiving the cerfiticate on storage media.)
.SS "Reading HTML mail"
You need either the
.I w3m
or
.I lynx
utility
or another command-line web browser
that can write plain text to standard output.
.nf
.sp
    \fBset pipe-text/html="\fIw3m -dump -T text/html\fB"\fR
.sp
.fi
or
.nf
.sp
    \fBset pipe-text/html="\fIlynx -dump -force_html /dev/stdin\fB"\fR
.sp
.fi
will then cause HTML message parts to be converted into a more friendly form.
.SS "Viewing PDF attachments"
Most PDF viewers do not accept input directly from a pipe.
It is thus necessary to store the attachment in a temporary file, as with
.nf
.sp
    \fBset pipe-application/pdf="cat >/tmp/nail$$.pdf; \e
           acroread /tmp/nail$$.pdf; rm /tmp/nail$$.pdf"\fR
.sp
.fi
Note that security defects are discovered in PDF viewers
from time to time.
Automatical command execution like this
can compromise your system security,
in particular if you stay not always informed
about such issues.

.SH NOTES
.PP
Variables in the environment passed to
.I nail
cannot be unset.
.PP
The character set conversion relies heavily
on the
.IR iconv (3)
function.
Its functionality differs widely
between the various system environments
\fInail\fR runs on.
.PP
Nail expects input text to be in Unix format,
with lines separated by 
.I newline
(^J, \en) characters only.
Non-Unix text files that use
.I carriage return
(^M, \er)
characters in addition will be treated as binary data;
to send such files as text, strip these characters e.\ g. by
.RS
.sp
tr \-d '\e015' <input | nail .\ .\ .

Limitations with IMAP mailboxes are:
It is not possible to edit messages,
but it is possible to append them.
Thus to edit a message,
create a local copy of it,
edit it, append it,
and delete the original.
The line count for the header display
is only appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded
from the server.
The marking of messages as `new' is performed by the IMAP server;
use of the
.I exit
command instead of
.I quit
will not cause it to be reset.
Message numbers may change with IMAP
every time before the prompt is printed
if \fInail\fR is notified by the server
that messages have been deleted
by some other client or process.
In this case, `Expunged \fIn\fR messages' is printed,
and message numbers may have changed.
.PP
Limitations with POP3 mailboxes are:
It is not possible to edit messages,
they can only be copied and deleted.
The line count for the header display
is only appropriate if the entire message has been downloaded
from the server.
The status field of a message is maintained by the server
between connections;
some servers do not update it at all,
and with a server that does,
the `exit' command will not cause the message status to be reset.
The `newmail' command and the `newmail' variable
have no effect.
.PP
An unencrypted IMAP or POP3 message download
can be interrupted from the terminal,
but the part that was not downloaded
will have to be downloaded
before the next command is sent.
A SSL/TLS encrypted IMAP or POP3 message download
should not be interrupted,
as this will very likely cause an error in the SSL transport.
.PP
There is no support for SSL/TLS certificate revocation lists (CRLs) yet.
.PP
As \fInail\fR is a mail user agent,
it provides only basic SMTP services.
If it fails to contact its upstream SMTP server,
it will not make further attempts to transfer the message
at a later time,
and it does not leave other information about this condition
than an error message on the terminal
and a `dead.letter' file.
This is usually not a problem if the SMTP server
is located in the same local network
as the computer on which \fInail\fR is run.
However, care should be taken when using a remote server of an ISP;
it might be better to set up a local SMTP server then
which just acts as a proxy.
.PP
\fINail\fR immediately contacts the SMTP server (or
.IR \%/usr/lib/sendmail )
even when operating in
.I disconnected
mode.
It would not make much sense for \fInail\fR to defer outgoing mail
since SMTP servers usually provide
much more elaborated delay handling
than \fInail\fR could perform as a client.
Thus the recommended setup for sending mail in
.I disconnected
mode is to configure a local SMTP server
such that it sends outgoing mail
as soon as an external network connection is available again,
i.\|e. to advise it to do that from a network startup script.
.PP
\fINail\fR is intended to be
a MIME-conformant mail user agent,
with the following exception:
No special handling of `multipart/alternative' messages is performed;
all parts with content types of `text' or `message' are shown.
This is done because the user should see as much information as possible.
.PP
A \fImail\fR command appeared in Version 1 AT&T Unix.
Berkeley Mail was written in 1978 by Kurt Shoens.
This man page is derived from
from The Mail Reference Manual
originally written by Kurt Shoens.
\fINail\fR enhancements are maintained and documented
by Gunnar Ritter.
